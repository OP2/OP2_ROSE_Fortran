ROSE-HPCT
Interfaces for accessing HPCToolkit data within ROSE translators

---------------
Getting Started
---------------

ROSE-HPCT is *not* built by default during a typical build
of ROSE. To enable it, specify the configure-time option:

  --enable-rosehpct

A successful build creates librosehpct.so, installed by
default in <prefix>/lib along with the other ROSE libraries.
Since ROSE-HPCT is experimental, it is *not* included in
librose.so, and so needs to be linked against explicitly.


*** External library dependencies ***

ROSE-HPCT does *not* depend on having an HPCToolkit installation
because it operates on the XML-output of HPCToolkit.

ROSE-HPCT does depend on the Gnome libxml2 XML parsing library to
process the HPCToolkit data files, and configure will try to
auto-detect this on your system. If it fails, you can specify
the root of the libxml2 installation tree manually:

  --with-libxml2=<install-tree>

where the libxml2 header files are assumed to be installed in
<install-tree>/libxml2/*, and the libraries are in
<install-tree>/lib. These are the default locations paths
for libxml2.

Alternatively, the implementation can also use the Xerces-C XML
processing library, but this is currently disabled.

-----------
Basic Usage
-----------

To get a quick overview of how to augment a ROSE translator
to import HPCToolkit data, see:

  examples/test_highlevel.cc

This example compiles to a driver that can import HPCToolkit
data, attach it to an AST, and dumps a PDF with attributes
corresponding to the metric data.

The Bourne-shell script, examples/test_hl*.sh, shows how
to run the above driver on the test data in
examples/data subdirectory.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation for ROSE-HPCT is included and built with
the ROSE documentation.
