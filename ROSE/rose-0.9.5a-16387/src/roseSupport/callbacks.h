     *  This template defines ordered containers of callback functors and thread-safe functions for accessing the containers.
     *
     *  @section ROSE_Callbacks_List_Example1 Example Usage
     *
     *  The first step is to create a functor class having one or more callbacks (operator() methods), each of which takes a
     *  struct reference containing the data to which the callback is applied.
     *
     *  @code
     *  class MyCallback: public MyCallbackBase { //base class optional
     *  public:
     *      MyCallback(): ncalls(0) {}
     *
     *      // Callback argument structure.  Data members can be anything
     *      // you want, and you can even have more than one of these
     *      // structs--one per callback signature.  The constructor
     *      // should generally just assign arguments to data members.
     *      struct Args {
     *          Args(SgAsmInstruction *insn, int callno, char *name):
     *              insn(insn), callno(callno), name(name) {}
     *          SgAsmInstruction *insn;
     *          int callno;
     *          char *name;
     *      };
     *
     *      // The callback.  You can overload these, but they'll all
     *      // take two arguments where the first is a Boolean and the
     *      // second is one of the argument types you defined above.
     *      bool operator()(bool b, const Args &args) {
     *          ncalls++;
     *          printf(stderr,"%s: %d\n", args.name, args.callno);
     *          insns.push_back(args.insn);
     *          return b;
     *      }
     *
     *      // Some data members accessible by the callback(s)
     *      size_t ncalls;
     *      static std::vector<SgAsmInstruction*> insns;
     *  };
     *  @endcode
     *
     *  The second step is to create a list to hold these callbacks. Our example callback was derived from a base class, so
     *  we'll use that base class as the list element type.
     *
     *  @code
     *  typedef ROSE_Callbacks::List<MyCallbackBase> MyCallbackList;
     *  MyCallbackList cbl;
     *  @endcode
     *
     *  Add some callbacks to the list. We'll just add one for this example.
     *
     *  @code
     *  cbl.append(new MyCallback);
     *  @endcode
     *
     *  Finally, invoke all the callbacks in the list, supplying some arguments that will be used for each callback.
     *
     *  @code
     *  bool result = cbl.apply(true, MyCallback::Args(insn, 5, "foo"));
     *  @endcode
