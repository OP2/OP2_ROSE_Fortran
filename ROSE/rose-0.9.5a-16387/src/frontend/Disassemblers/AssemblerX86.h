/** This class contains methods for assembling x86 instructions (SgAsmx86Instruction).
 *
 *  End users will generally not need to use the AssemblerX86 class directly. Instead, they will call Assembler::create() to
 *  create an assembler that's appropriate for a particular binary file header or interpretation and then use that assembler to
 *  assemble instructions.
 *
 *  The assembler itself is quite small compared to the disassembler (about one third the size) and doesn't actually know about
 *  any instructions; it only knows how to encode various prefixes and operand addressing modes.  For each instruction to be
 *  assembled, the assembler consults a dictionary of assembly definitions. The instruction is looked up in this dictionary and
 *  the chosen definition then drives the assembly. If the instruction being assembled matches multiple definitions then each
 *  valid definition is tried and the "best" one (see Assembler::set_encoding_type()) is returned.
 *
 *  The dictionary is generated directly from the Intel "Instruction Set Reference" PDF documentation as augmented by a small
 *  text file in this directory. The IntelAssemblyBuilder perl script generates AssemblerX86Init.h and AssemblerX86Init.C, which
 *  contain the X86InstructionKind enumeration, a function to initialize the dictionary (AssemblerX86::initAssemblyRules()),
 *  and a function for converting an X86InstructionKind constant to a string (AssemblerX86::to_str()). */
