This directory demonstrates the use of the Intel Pin framework for
binary instrumentation with ROSE.  The use of Intel Pin permits
the mixing of both static and dynamic analysis of binaries and
also the dynamic analysis of executables built after (or before)
the static analysis of the source code.

More information on the details of using Intel Pin with ROSE is 
in the ROSE Tutorial (in the chapter on Binary Analysis).

NOTE: we currently require that as part of the Intel Pin support, 
the user must include the location of the libdwarf.so library 
into the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
