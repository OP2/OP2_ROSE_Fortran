\chapter{Tutorial Wrap-up}

    This tutorial has shown the construction and simple manipulation of the AST as part of
the construction of the source-to-source translators using ROSE.  Much more complex
translators are possible using ROSE, but they are not such that they present well as part
of a tutorial with short example programs. The remaining chapters of the tutorial
include examples of translators built using ROSE as part of active collaborations with 
external research groups.

       academic collaborations.}
