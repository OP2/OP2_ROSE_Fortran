This is the support in ROSE for java to call ROSE (by Valentin David).

The std_list.i file is a fix coming from recent work on SWIG and is 
a modified version of std_vector.i.  It contains a simpler definition
of STL list for SWIG.

testlink.cc is a program to test if all the function prototypes in 
ROSE have corresponding definitions.  It links ROSE with the extension 
of ROSE for JAVA.
