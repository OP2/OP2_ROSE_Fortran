/* Demonstrates how to get the function that an instruction belongs to.
 *
 * There are three steps:
 *
 *   1.  You have to disassemble the instructions (ROSE's Disassembler classes) and partition them into basic blocks and
 *       functions (ROSE's Partitioner class).  The RSIM_Process::disassemble() will do all this for you and cache the results
 *       in the RSIM_Process object of the simulator.  The RSIM_Tools::MemoryDisassembler is another way to do this--it
 *       triggers RSIM_Process::disassemble() when a certain instruction is hit. If you don't run the disassembler over the
 *       whole process memory, the instruction you'll get back won't have any basic block or function information.  In other
 *       words, you can't discover basic blocks or functions if you only disassemble one instruction--you have to disassemble a
 *       whole bunch.
 *
 *   2.  You have to obtain a pointer to an instruction (SgAsmInstruction).  The best way to get a single instruction is with
 *       RSIM_Process::get_instruction(), which takes a specimen virtual address and returns, if possible, an instruction that
 *       was cached in step 1.  If an instruction isn't cached, then the disassembler is called to obtain a single instruction,
 *       and in this case the instruction won't have basic block or function information.
 *
 *       Another alternative is to write an instruction callback that will be invoked for every simulated instruction and an
 *       SgAsmInstruction will be passed as one of its arguments.  That's what we do in this example.
 *
 *   3.  Once you have an instruction pointer, you just traverse upward in the AST to find the SgAsmFunctionDeclaration
 *       node. There are four cases:
 *         A.  The instruction has no SgAsmFunctionDeclaration parent.  This can happen if you asked for an instruction that
 *             wasn't run through the partitioning process.  Perhaps you didn't call the disassembler, the disassembler didn't
 *             disassemble at that address for some reason, or the memory containing the instruction has been modified since
 *             the instruction was first disassembled.
 *         B.  The instruction's SgAsmFunctionDeclaration has the FUNC_LEFTOVERS bit set in the vector returned by the
 *             get_reason() method.  This means the Partitioner couldn't figure out which function this instruction belongs to,
 *             so it lumped it into a catch-all function.  Be aware that control flow analysis etc. will probably be
 *             meaningless on this function.
 *         C.  The SgAsmFunctionDeclaration has an empty name string.  This means that the instruction's function was detected,
 *             but the Partitioner couldn't find any information in symbol tables.  The RSIM_Process::disassemble() will only
 *             know about symbol tables in the main executable, not symbol tables in shared objects that were linked in by the
 *             dynamic linker. (We hope to remedy this).  If the function has no name, you can probably create your own name by
 *             using the function's unique entry address (see SgAsmFunctionDeclaration::get_entry_va()).
 *         D.  Otherwise the function exists and has a name.
 *
 * This test simply prints the name of every instruction's function if known.
 *

 *     $ demo7 ./demo7input
