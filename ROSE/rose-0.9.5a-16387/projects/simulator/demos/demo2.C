/* Demonstrates how to write a (very simple, naive) sign analysis.
 *
 * Run the program like this:
 *    $ demo2 ./demo2input 2>&1 |cat
 *
 * The pipe to "cat" is necessary only if you want to actually see the instructions.
 *
 * Documentation can be found by running:
 *    $ doxygen RSIM.dxy
 *    $ $WEB_BROWSER docs/html/index.html
 *
 *
 * The analysis itself is defined in the SignAnalysisExample namespace (see SignAnalysisExample.h).  The analysis values are
 * some combination of zero, negative, and positive.  Since memory addresses are in the same domain as values, we have three
 * possible memory locations. This is insufficient to determine the address of the next instruction (the EIP register), so we
 * must run the SignAnalysisExample in tandem with some other analysis.  The other analysis provides EIP values that we use to
 * fetch instructions to feed to the sign analysis.
 *
 * This is meant to be a VERY SIMPLE example.  Therefore, the other analysis (that provides EIP values) is simply the simulator
 * itself.  In other words, the sign analysis occurs in synchrony with the simulation of the specimen.  This is pretty useless
 * since we could just get the signs from the simulator's concrete state, but it serves its purpose as an example of how to
 * write another analysis.
 *
 * There are several alternatives to running synchronously.  For instance, if we know the current instruction then we can
 * perform sign analysis on that instruction and all following instructions as long as we can determine a unique control-flow
 * successor.  I.e., we can do the analysis on following instructions of the same basic block, plus subsequent basic blocks as
 * long as we can determine branch targets at the end of each block.  Another demo shows how the sign analysis can be used in
 * tandem with symbolic analysis.
