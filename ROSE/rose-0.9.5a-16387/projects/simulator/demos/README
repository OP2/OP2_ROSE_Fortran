This directory contains a number of demonstrations of how to use RSIM
for analysis.  They are meant as demos, not fully functional analyses,
and therefore have various shortcomings and aren't well tested.  Full
details of each demo are documented at the top of each demoN.C
file. The other source files might be shared between multiple demos.

Short descriptions (see source for full descriptions):

demo1: simulate a function that isn't normally called
demo2: sign analysis in synchrony with simulation
demo3: symbolic analysis of a function not normally called
demo4: sign analysis tethered to symbolic analysis
demo5: looks for buffer overflow being exploited; instructions on stack
demo6: instruction trace with function call information
demo7: how to get the function that an instruction belongs to
demo8: reports number of instructions and system calls
