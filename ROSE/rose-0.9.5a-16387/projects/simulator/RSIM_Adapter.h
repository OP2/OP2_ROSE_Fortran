/** Adapters.
 *
 *  An adapter is an object that can be attached to a simulator to change the simulator's behavior, and then detached to
 *  restore the simulator to its original behavior.
 *
 *  An example of an adapter is TraceIO, which monitors data transfers on specified file descriptors and reports them using the
 *  tracing facility.  In order to accomplish this, the adapter augments a number of system calls by registering additional
 *  callbacks for those system calls.  Users can manually augment system calls, but using an adapter is a good way for the user
 *  to ensure that all system calls relevant to a certain kind of analysis are properly agumented.
 *
 *  Various subclasses of TraceIO add additional features, such as automatically enabling and disabling file descriptors of
 *  various types as they are created and closed.  For instance, RSIM_Adapter::TraceFileIO traces normal files by tracking
 *  sys_open(), sys_creat(), sys_close(), etc.
 *
 *  More than one adapter can be attached to a simulator, and a a single adapter can be attached to multiple simulators.  But
 *  the adapter should not be destroyed until after it's detached from all simulators.  See RSIM_Adapter::AdapterBase::attach() and
 *  RSIM_Adapter::AdapterBase::detach() for details.

     *                                  Selective Syscall Disabling Adapter
     **************************************************************************************************************************/

    /** An adapter to enable/disable specific system calls.
     *
     *  This adapter, when attached to a simulator, allows a user to enable or disable specific system calls. System calls are
     *  either enabled, disabled, or in a default state (either enabled or disabled depending on the constructor
     *  arguments). System calls are identified by call number and can be found in <asm/unistd_32.h> for the RSIM_Linux32
     *  simulator.
     *
     *  Simply speaking, whenever the specimen attempts to invoke a disabled system call the call is made to appear to fail by
     *  returning a "Function not implemented" error.  However, the adapter can be configured via a callback list which is
     *  executed when a system call is about to be skipped.
     *
     *  Here's what happens in detail when the specimen tries to invoke a disabled system call:
     *
     *  <ol>
     *    <li>That system call's "enter" callbacks are performed, possibly emiting system call tracing messages.</li>
     *    <li>A message is printed to the TRACE_MISC facility indicating that the system call is disabled.</li>
     *    <li>The system call return value is set to -ENOSYS ("Function not implemented"). The callbacks in the next step may
     *        replace this with some other return value.</li>
     *    <li>All user specified callbacks registered with this adapter (see get_callbacks()) are invoked on behalf of the
     *        system call.  The list is invoked with the Boolean value initially set to false. If this callback list returns
     *        true then:
     *        <ol>
     *          <li>the system call is immediately enabled</li>
     *          <li>a message to that effect is emitted to the TRACE_MISC facility</li>
     *          <li>the system call will eventually execute (after the remaining pre-syscall callbacks finish and return
     *              true)</li>
     *        </ol>
     *        otherwise
     *        <ol>
     *          <li>The system call remains disabled</li>
     *          <li>All syscall "leave" callbacks run, possibly tracing the syscall return value.</li>
     *        </ol>
     *        </li>
     *  </ol>
     *
     *  @section SyscallDisabler_Example1 Example: Disabling networking
     *
     *  Here's how to make it impossible for a non-root specimen to make a network connection.  The sys_socketcall()
     *  encapsulates all socket operations on x86 Linux: socket, bind, listen, connect, accept, send, recv, etc.  So disabling
     *  that one system call disables any ability for the specimen to connect to the network.
     *
     *  @code
     *  // Leave all system calls enabled by default
     *  RSIM_Adapter::SyscallDisabler no_network(true);
     *
     *  // Give the adapter a name other than SyscallDisabler. This makes the
     *  // reason-for-disabled more obvious in the tracing output.
     *  no_network.prefix("NoNetwork: ");
     *
     *  // Disable system calls that are required to open a network connection
     *  no_network.disable_syscall(102); // 102 is sys_socketcall
     *
     *  // Attach the adapter to the simulator
     *  no_network.attach(simulator);
     *  @endcode
     *
     *  The output, when the simulator is run with "--debug=syscall", may look something like this:
     *  @verbatim

     *
     *  @section SyscallDisabler_Example2 Example: Interactive enabling
     *
     *  By default, if the specimen attempts to invoke a disabled system call the call is simply skipped and the EAX register
     *  is adjusted to make it appear as if the error "Function not implemented" was returned.  However, the adapter allows
     *  disabled system calls to be enabled. This is accomplished by registering a callback with the adapter. The callback
     *  should return true to enable the system call.
     *
     *  This example initialially disables all system calls, and then queries the user about whether each call should be
     *  invoked as the system call is reached.  This example is not thread safe.
     *
     *  @code
     *  struct Ask: public RSIM_Simulator::SystemCall::Callback {
     *      std::set<int> asked; // syscalls we asked about
     *      bool operator()(bool syscall_enabled, const Args &args) {

     *              asked.insert(args.callno);
     *              fprintf(stderr, "System call %d is currently disabled. "
     *                      "What should I do? (s=skip, e=enable) [s] ", args.callno);
     *              char buf[200];
     *              if (fgets(buf, sizeof buf, stdin) && buf[0]=='e')
     *                  syscall_enabled = true;
     *          }
