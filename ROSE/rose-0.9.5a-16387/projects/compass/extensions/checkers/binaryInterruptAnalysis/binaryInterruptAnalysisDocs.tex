\section{Binary Interrupt Analysis}
\label{BinaryInterruptAnalysis::overview}

This analysis looks for intx80 instruction calls. If such a call is detected,
a dataflow analysis traces back the eax register to determine what Linux system call will being executed.

E.g. if eax == 1 , its a sys\_exit, eax == 3, its a sys\_read or eax == 4 is a sys\_write.


\subsection{Parameter Requirements}

None.

\subsection{Implementation}

This analysis operates on a graph, not an AST.

See binaryInterruptAnalysis.C
