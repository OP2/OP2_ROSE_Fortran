November 26 - 2007 to December 06-2007: (note from Andreas)
  We removed checkers that enforce forbidden functions and enforced
  the same rules with the more general forbiddenFunctions checker.
  The following checkers was removed:
  bufferOverflowFunctions, noRand, noVfork, preferFseekToRewind,
  stringTokenToIntegerConverter

  Fixed a problem with the documentation generation.

  Rewrote copyConstructorConstArg as it did not conform to its intended
  function. The new version is also faster.

  Rewrote explicitCharSign to conform to new specification at US CERT.

  Made all checkers in compass pass the make testCxx_Grammar and 
  make testAllCheckersSeparately.

  Made sure that all checkers written is integrated into compass. This
  is part of the preparation for the abolishment of the COMPASS_SUBMIT
  repository.

  Marked the following checkers as stable:
   copyConstructorConstArg
   cyclomaticComplexity
   defaultCase
   duffsDevice
   explicitCharSign
   floatForLoopCounter
   floatingPointExactComparison
   forbiddenFunctions
   nameAllParameters
   NullDerefAnalysis
   time_tDirectManipulat

December 6 - 2007
  Change name of CHANGE_LOG file to ChangeLog to be consistant with
  GNU standards.

January 4 - 2008 (note from Gary Yuan)
  The following checkers are not giving any output but do not otherwise cause any errors. I don't know the reason for their incorrect results:
     constructorDestructorCallsVirtualFunction (invalid pointer)
     nonStandardTypeRefReturns (??)
     nonVirtualRedefinition (??)
     TypeTypedef (??)
  I advise removing these checkers from the release.
  Finally note that these checkers that use boost were not checked by me using the regression mechanism:
     nullDeref
     nameConsistency
     newDelete


January 18 - 2008 (note from Andreas)

  Added mechanism to select checkers
  Refactored code for Compass::openFile(std::string) from Paramaters into that function
  Added documentation for how to create a skeleton checker
  Added documentation for how to integrate a checker into compass
