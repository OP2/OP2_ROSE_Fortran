This directory tests the use of the GNU "-include" option to specify the use of
a specific header file in advance of all other header files.  In this case it places
the specified header file after the "rose_edg_required_macros_and_functions.h".
See the Makefile.am for the example of the commandline used, or run "make check"
to run the tests and see the commandlines generated.
