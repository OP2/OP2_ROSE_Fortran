This test checks that ROSE can correctly detect and unparse preprocessor directives (or comments) that appear in a header file, which is included in more than one place. The bug that this test exposes consists in ROSE attaching preprocessor directives or comments only to a single occurrence of the content of the header file included in multiple places. In this test, the bug would cause ROSE to attach the #include preprocessor directive to the last occurrence, but the first occurrence, which does not get the required preprocessor directive, is unparsed, thus causing this test to fail, unless ROSE attaches preprocessor directives to all occurrences.
