In this test, a single source file includes two header files in different scopes. One of the header files declares a class. The other one is in a different folder and contains several nested scopes, each including one or more other header files from the same folder (4 in total), also, it declares a variable in the most outer scope. Only the two header files that are included in the source file should be unparsed because there are no changes to other included header files. The unparsed header files should find correctly their included not unparsed header files.
