ALL tools in this directory provide a command line interface that conforms
to the GNU standard. For every tool --help gives you a brief description
of the command line parameters and available options.

* Translation Tools

Several of the tools use example translators built with ROSE to
translate input from language A to output in language
B. The naming scheme is always: <InputLanguage>2<OutputLanguage>
similar to tools like ps2pdf or ps2ps.

The 4 available tools are:
cpp2cpp (uses exampleTranslator/defaultTranslator)
cpp2ps (uses exampleTranslator/DOTGenerator and dot2ps)
cpp2pdf (uses exampleTranslator/PDFGenerator)
dot2ps (uses dot)

The abrivations used stand for:
cpp : CPlusPlus, 
ps  : PostScript, 
pdf : (Adobe's) Portable Document Format
dot : dot is a tool for hierarchical layout (part of AT&T's graphviz package)
    : the language accepted by dot is the DOT language
    : http://www.research.att.com/~erg/graphviz/info/lang.html

* Visualization tools used in the documentation generation

lsviz : visualizes a directory structure as a graph (by using dot) and
        generates files in various formats like postscript, gif, jpeg, etc.
        It translates the output of ls to a dot tree description and 
        invokes dot. Several parameters allow to customize the output.

pragmarize: workaround for a bug in ROSE (fixed in a later internal release)
            - replaces strings '//#pragma' with 'pragma'
