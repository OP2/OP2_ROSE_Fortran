\textbf{Note}: This copy of the tutorial was not built with
\texttt{--enable-rosehpct} at configure-time. Thus, all the sample outputs
that appear in this chapter are not ``live,'' \emph{i.e.}, have been
pre-generated rather than generated from actual runs at the time this
copy of the tutorial was created.
