All header files found in a source tree should be used somewhere in that source
tree. Unused header files are characteristic of deleted code that should be
removed.  This policy only considers #include directives that don't specify a
directory since all ROSE include directories are specified with the "-I" switch
of the compiler.  A separate policy checks that header file names are unique so
that the "-I" switch behaves reasonably.  The following header files exist
but are unused:
