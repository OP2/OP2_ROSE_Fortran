This project is used to list all headers in the given directory which are not included in the input code.

The usage is like this:
headerFilesNotIncludedList <inputfile> -P <target directory> [-I <include directory>] [-D <macro defined>]

For example, given a source file "test.C" like below:

//>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
// the whole content of the source file
#include <rose.h>
//<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Assume the ROSE include directory is $(ROSE_DIR)/include. You can list all headers in $(ROSE_DIR)/include which are not included in the file above:

./headerFilesNotIncludedList test.C -P $(ROSE_DIR)/include -I $(ROSE_DIR)/include

The output is a list of header files.
