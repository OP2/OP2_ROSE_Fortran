ForbiddenFunctions.Function0=vfork,Should not use vfork in POSIX programs
ForbiddenFunctions.Function1=sprintf,Using this function is likely to lead to a buffer overflow
ForbiddenFunctions.Function2=scanf,Using this function is likely to lead to a buffer overflow
ForbiddenFunctions.Function3=sscanf,Using this function is likely to lead to a buffer overflow, and string-to-integer conversions should use strtol()
ForbiddenFunctions.Function4=gets,Using this function is likely to lead to a buffer overflow
ForbiddenFunctions.Function5=strcpy,Using this function is likely to lead to a buffer overflow
ForbiddenFunctions.Function6=_mbscpy,Using this function is likely to lead to a buffer overflow
ForbiddenFunctions.Function7=lstrcat,Using this function is likely to lead to a buffer overflow
ForbiddenFunctions.Function8=memcpy,Check the buffer size to prevent buffer overflows
ForbiddenFunctions.Function9=strcat,Using this function is likely to lead to a buffer overflow -- use strncat() instead
ForbiddenFunctions.Function10=rand,The rand() function does not produce high-quality random numbers
ForbiddenFunctions.Function11=rewind,Prefer fseek() to rewind because it detects errors
ForbiddenFunctions.Function12=atoi,Use strtol() for converting strings to numbers
ForbiddenFunctions.Function13=atol,Use strtol() for converting strings to numbers
ForbiddenFunctions.Function14=atoll,Use strtoll() for converting strings to numbers
ForbiddenFunctions.Function15=atof,Use strtod() for converting strings to numbers
ForbiddenFunctions.Function16=compass_forbidden_function_vfork,This is our sample forbidden function
ForbiddenFunctions.Function17=unparse,leads to performance degredation in Compass
ForbiddenFunctions.Function18=unparseToString,leads to performance degredation in Compass
