/* Design rules:
 *   1. All public symbols in this file should use the "RTS_" prefix (ROSE Thread Support).
 *
 *   2. All constructs that have a user-supplied compound statement as a "body", have a matching "_END" macro.  For instance,
 *      RTS_MUTEX starts a mutual exclusion for a critical section, which ends with an RTS_MUTEX_END macro.  The END macros
 *      generally take no arguments.
 *
 *   3. Locally scoped symbols defined by the macros have names beginning with "RTS_". This is generally followed by the first
 *      letter of the rest of the macro name, a letter "s" or "p" for "shared" or "private", and an underscore.  For example,
 *      within the RTS_MUTEX macros, a private (non-shared) variable might be named "RTS_Mp_mutex".
 *
 *   4. Constructs that allow a user-supplied compound statement as a "body" should allow the body to "break" or "throw". Both
 *      forms of premature exit should behave as if the body executed to completion (except in the case of throw, the exception
 *      is raised again automatically).

/** Protect a critical section with a mutual exclusion lock.
 *
 *  This macro should be used within ROSE whenever we need to obtain a lock for a critical section. The critical section should
 *  end with a matching RTS_MUTEX_END macro.  The suggested code style is to use curly braces and indentation to help visually
 *  line up the RTS_MUTEX with the RTS_MUTEX_END, such as:
 *
 *  @code
 *  RTS_MUTEX(class_mutex) {
 *      critical_section_goes_here;
 *  } RTS_MUTEX_END;
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  The critical section should not exit the construct except through the RTS_MUTEX_END macro.  In other words, the critical
 *  section should not have "return" statements, longjmps, or any "goto" that branches outside the critical section.  However,
 *  "break" statements and exceptions are supported.
 *
 *  If the mutex is an error checking mutex then ROSE will assert that the lock is not already held by this thread. If the
 *  mutex is recursive then the lock will be obtained recursively if necessary.

/** Initializer synchronization.
 *
 *  Sometimes we want a critical section to be executed only by the first thread to call the function and all other threads
 *  that might call the same function should block until the first caller completes.  These macros can be used for that
 *  purpose.
 *
 *  The MUTEX is briefly locked to inspect the state of initilization, and then unlocked before the user-supplied body is
 *  executed.  The user is permitted to obtain the mutex lock again in the body if desired, although this is only necessary if
 *  other code paths (outside the RTS_INIT construct) might interfere with the body.
 *
 *  If ALLOW_RECURSION is true, then a recursive call from the body will jump over the RTS_INIT construct without doing
 *  anything (other than briefly obtaining the mutex lock to inspect the state of initializatione). Otherwise a recursive call
 *  from the body is considered a logic error and the process will be aborted. For convenience, we define two additional
 *  macros, RTS_INIT_RECURSIVE and RTS_INIT_NONRECURSIVE, which may be used in place of the two-argument RTS_INIT macro.
 *
 *  The user-supplied body may exit prematurely either by a "break" statement or by throwing an exception.  In either case, the
 *  initialization is assumed to have completed and the body will not be executed by any other future call.  Any other kind of
 *  premature exit from the body (return, goto, longjmp, etc) results in undefined behavior.
 *
 *  Example code. Consider a class method which is responsible for one-time initialization of certain class data
 *  structures. This initialization function is called by nearly every other method in the class, and therefore anything that
 *  the initialization function does might result in a recursive call to the initializer.
