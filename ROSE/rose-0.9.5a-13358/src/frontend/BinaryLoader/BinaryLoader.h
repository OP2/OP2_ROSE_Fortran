/** Base class for loading a static or dynamic object.
 *
 *  The BinaryLoader class is the base class that defines the public interface and provides generic implementations for
 *  loading a static or dynamic object.  "Loading" means parsing, linking, mapping, and relocating, which are defined as
 *  follows:
 *
 *  <ul>
 *    <li>Parsing: reading the contents of a binary file and parsing the container format (ELF, PE, COFF, Dwarf, etc) to
 *        produce an abstract syntax tree (AST).  Although the container is parsed, the actual machine instructions are
 *        not (that is, disassembly is not part of loading).</li>
 *    <li>Linking: recursively parsing all shared object dependencies. This step does not include mapping memory into a
 *        process address space or fixing up relocation information.</li>
 *    <li>Mapping: choosing virtual addresses for parts of the binary file as if ROSE were creating a new OS process. For
 *        instance, mapping an ELF file will cause ROSE to choose virtual addresses for all the ELF Segments.  This has
 *        two side effects. First, the SgAsmGenericSection::get_mapped_actual_rva() method will now return the address that
 *        ROSE chose for the section rather than the same value as get_mapped_preferred_rva(), although they will often still
 *        be the same after loading. Second, the MemoryMap object returned by SgAsmInterpretation::get_map() will be updated
 *        to include a mapping from virtual addresses to the SgAsmGenericSection content.</li>
 *    <li>Relocation: applying relocation fixups to patch pointers and offsets in various parts of the virtual address
 *        space.</li>
 *  </ul>
 * 
 *  Some goals of this design are:
 *  <ul>
 *    <li>to load an entire binary into memory in a manner similar to how the operating system would do so.</li>
 *    <li>to generically handle both static and dynamic executables, treating static as a special case of dynamic.</li>
 *    <li>to handle a variety of binary container formats (ELF, PE, etc) and loaders (Linux and Windows).</li>
 *    <li>to be able to control the locations of shared object dependencies without affecting how ROSE itself is loaded.</li>
 *    <li>to be able to emulate linking of one operating system while ROSE is running in another operating system.</li>
 *    <li>to load an entire binary at once or one part at a time. This is useful when emulating ldopen().</li>
 *    <li>to be able to partially load an object. Useful when not all libraries are available.</li>
 *    <li>to allow a user to register a new loader subclass at runtime and have ROSE use it when appropriate.</li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  The general design is similar to the Disassembler class.  The BinaryLoader has class methods to register user-defined
 *  loaders with the library and each loader is able to answer whether it is capable of loading a particular kind of binary.
 *  ROSE (or any user of this class) can obtain a suitable loader for a particular SgAsmInterpretation, clone it (if desired),
 *  modify properties that control its behavior, and use it to load a binary.

     *    <li>Memory alignment. The @p malign_lo and @p malign_hi indicate how the section must be aligned in memory.

     *        @p mem_size will be a multiple of @p malign_hi.</li>
     *    <li>Memory location: The @p va value is the low virtual address of the new mapping, and the @p mem_size is
     *        the number of bytes to map.</li>
     *    <li>File location: The @p offset value is the byte offset from the beginning of the file in which this
     *        section appears, and the @p file_size is the number of bytes to map from the file into memory. The
     *        @p file_size may be smaller than the @p mem_size (see below).</li>
     *    <li>Internal offset: The size of the memory mapping may be larger than the section itself. When this
     *        happens, the section will be located somewhere inside the mapped region.  The @p va_offset
     *        is the offset of the section with respect to @p va (it must be non-negative).  The boolean return
     *        values @p anon_lo and @p anon_hi determine whether ROSE will map file contents (false) or zeros (true)
     *        below and above the section when the section is smaller than the mapped region.  Zeros are always
     *        used for areas that are beyond the end of the file.</li>
     *    <li>Conflicts: If an attempt is made to map a region into part of the address space that already has
     *        a mapping, then one of three things can happen: (1) a MemoryMap::Inconsistent exception is thrown,
     *        (2) a hole can be created by first unmapping the space in conflict, or (3) a new mapping can be chosen
     *        automatically.  The @p resolve result indicates what should happen.</li>
     *  </ul>

     *  Subclasses often override this method since each operating system tends to have unique rules about how
     *  things are mapped and how conflicts are resolved.
     *
     *  If so desired, the conflict resolution may be handled by the align_values() method itself since the memory map is
     *  available there. However, a benefit of allowing a higher layer to resolve the conflict is that diagnostics will
     *  be produced automatically when debugging is enabled.
     *
