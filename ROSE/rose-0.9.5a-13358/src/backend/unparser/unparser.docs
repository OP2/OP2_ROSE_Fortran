     \defgroup backendGenerator Backend C and C++ Code Generator
     \ingroup ROSE_BackEndGroup

     \brief Generates C or C++ Source code from the AST.

     Generates C++ source code directly from AST (this is older style code not yet
     rewritten to use
     ROSE tree traversal mechanism).  Parts of this code were borrowed from the original
     Sage II unparser.  Internally several options are available so that the generated
     code can either reference the user's original source code or the generated code
     (\#line \<number\> \<filename\>; is used to optionally reference the original user's file).
     This is a standard practice to permit generated code to work with debuggers (used by
     many compilers internally).

     The only user level function associated with the backend is the call to the 
     <b>SgProject::unparse()</b> member function, which generates the source code
     associated with the internal AST.  If the ASt had been transformed, then the
     transformations will be represented as changes between the generated code and
     the original input application code (user's application).

          <b>There are no user level functions within the backend.  The only three related
          functions are available from the SgNode interface ( SgNode::unparseToString() ) and
          SgFile and SgProject interfaces ( SgFile::unparse() and SgProject::unparse(),
          respectively).</b>

          \brief This class represents the Backend C++ Code Generator within ROSE.

          \note Large parts of documentation contained in <b>ROSE/src/unparser.docs</b>.

          This is the source code generator.  It traverses the AST (not using the new traversal
          mechanisms) and generates C++ source code from the constructs within the AST.
          Special attention is given to formatting the generated code.

          \internal This class could be simplified now that the comments and CPP directives are
                    a part of the AST.
