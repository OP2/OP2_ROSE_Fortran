In this test, a single source file includes two header files, each declaring a different class. Also, these header files include two different other header files with the same name (and each of the inner header files declares a distinct variable). To avoid path collisions among the unparsed and not unparsed header files (i.e. to avoid finding the wrong file with the same name), additionally to the header files affected by the rename variable transformation, ROSE unparses one not affected file.
