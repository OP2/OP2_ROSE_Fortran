This is a project to 
* use Flex/Bison to parse OpenMP pragmas based on Markus's contributions
* support the latest OpenMP 3.0 syntax
* refine the OmpAttribute data structure to separate interface from implementation

File List:

* OpenMP persistent attributes:  OmpAttribute.C and OmpAttribute.h
  Moved to src/frontend/SageIII

* Flex scanner:   omplexer.ll (omplexer.cc )
  Bison parser:   ompparser.yy (ompparser.cc, ompparser.h)

  Moved to src/frontend/CxxFrontend/EDG_SAGE_Connection

* test parser:    parseOmp.C 

Please avoid to use file names which differ from each other only by suffix.
