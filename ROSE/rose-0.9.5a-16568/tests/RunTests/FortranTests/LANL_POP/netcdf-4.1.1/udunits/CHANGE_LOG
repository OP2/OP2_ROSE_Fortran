2.1.9	2009-09-09
	Fixed bug in ut_are_convertible() that caused it to return true
	for m2.s-2 and m.s-2.

	Changed installation directory for units database files from
	$(datadir) (default: /usr/local/share) to $(pkgdatadir)
	(default: /usr/local/share/udunits).

	Changed name of "ut_unit*" member in the UDUNITS-1 "utUnit"
	backward-compatibility structure from "ut_unit" to "unit2"
	because, unlike C, the g++ compiler doesn't allow a member to
	have the same name as a typedef.

	Added version specification to the top-level UDUNITS-2
	documentation.

2.1.8	2009-06-19
	Corrected definition of "lbf": was "2000 force_pounds"; is now
	"1 force_pound".

2.1.7	2009-05-05
	Replaced angle brackets with quotation marks in inclusion of the
	UDUNITS-2 header-file by the UDUNITS-1 header-file.  This was
	done to accomodate ncview's configure-script and because it's
	the right thing to do because both header-files are installed in the
	same directory.

	Added test for math library to configure script to support
	systems whose C library doesn't have them.

	Improved the process for making the "results.tab" target in the
	test/ subdirectory.

	Added delays to process for creating documentation source to
	accomodate broken HP-UX B.11.00 make(1).

	Added "make check" to git pre-commit hook.

2.1.6	2009-04-15
	Added to the installed, top-level, UDUNITS-2 documentation,
	commentary about the existence of a version 1 C API in the
	package.

	Moved the UDUNITS-1 API into the UDUNITS-2 library subdirectory,
	"lib", in order to allow "make check" to build the package.

2.1.5	2009-03-24
	Fixed bug in udunits2(1) utility introduced in version 2.1.2.
	Entering a "have" unit that didn't have a numerical first
	component risked a segmentation violation.

2.1.4	2009-03-24
	Documented the change in meaning of the symbol "g" from the
	original package (standard free fall) to this package (gram).

	Returned HP-UX to the set of tested operating systems.

2.1.3	2009-03-23
	Corrected typos in XML units database for "US_survey_foot" and
	"international_foot": removed embedded quotation marks.

2.1.2	2009-03-19
	Corrected program udunits2(1): it now correctly parses units
	like "0.1 lg(re 1.0e-12 W.m-2)".

	Made the dimensionless unit one format as "1".

	Corrected rule for target "web-update": changed "distname" to
	"distName".

	Corrected the development make(1) target "hostcheck": added
	setting of MAKEFLAGS to the empty string before invoking
	make(1).

2.1.1	2009-03-13
	Corrected and improved the development make(1) targets "ftp"
	and "download-update".

	Added publication of the XML database on the UDUNITS website to
	the target "web-update".

	Corrected typo in API documentation.

2.1.0	2009-03-11
	Added UDUNITS-1 API.  This thin interface uses the UDUNITS-2
	library.  Users will have to recompile their UDUNITS-1-based 
	code using the new "udunits.h" header-file and rebuild their
	programs using the new UDUNITS-2 library.  Because the UDUNITS-1
	API uses the "utUnit" data-structure and the UDUNITS-2 API uses
	pointers to "ut_unit" data-structures, a small memory-leak is 
	possible in code that creates many units.  This leak can be 
	avoided by calling the new method utFree(utUnit*) when the unit
	is no longer needed.

	Added some "const" qualifiers to the API.

	Modified ut_format() for timestamp units.  It now prints the
	long form (with hyphens and colons) if the year of the origin is
	less than 1000 or greater than 9999.  This was done to make
	ut_format() compatible with ut_parse().

2.0.4	2009-02-21
	Added copyright notices and LICENSE file.

2.0.3	2009-02-18
        Added the function ut_root(const ut_unit* unit, int root) to
        return a root of a unit (e.g., "m2/s2" -> "m/s").

2.0.2	2008-12-02
	Changed order of calls to ut_set_status() and
	ut_handle_error_message() so that the status value is always set
	before the error-message handler is called.  This allows error
	handlers to determine the cause of the message.

2.0.1	2008-11-13
	Added parsing of timestamps that have dashes and colons but also
	use "T" (e.g., "seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z").

	Corrected the regular expressions for matching the character-set
	specifier in the udunits2(1) program.

2.0.0	2007-07-18
	Initial release.
