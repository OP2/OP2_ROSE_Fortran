\page AvailableDocumentation Available ROSE Documentation

    This page specifies what documentation is available in ROSE and where to find it.
    There are three forms of documentation for ROSE (two of which are available in both 
    postscript and html):
     - \b ROSE \b User \b Manual \n
           The ROSE User Manual presents how to get started with ROSE and documents 
           features of the ROSE infrastructure.  The ROSE User Manual is found in 
           the \c ROSE/docs/Rose directory.
           The ROSE User Manual can also be found at (link to LaTeX document): \n
           <a href="../ROSE_UserManual/ROSE-@VERSION@-UserManual.ps"> ROSE UserManual (postscript version) </a>
           or \n
           <a href="../ROSE_UserManual/manual.html"> ROSE User Manual (html version) </a>. \n
     - \b ROSE \b Tutorial \n
           The ROSE Tutorial presents a collection of examples of how to use ROSE (found
           in the \c ROSE/tutorial directory).  The ROSE Tutorial documentation is found in 
           \c ROSE/docs/Rose/Tutorial directory.  
           Note that the \c ROSE/tutorial contains the exact same examples as appear in the
           tutorial, each example may also be modified and rerun (changing either the
           example translators or the inputs to the examples).  The ROSE Tutorial can 
           be found at (link to LaTeX document): \n
           <a href="../ROSE_Tutorial/ROSE-@VERSION@-Tutorial.ps"> ROSE Tutorial (postscript version) </a>
           or \n
           <a href="../ROSE_Tutorial/tutorial.html"> ROSE Tutorial (html version) </a>. \n
           The tutorial documentation is built in the following steps:
           -# actual source code for each example translator in the \c ROSE/tutorial directory
             is included into the tutorial documentation
           -# each example is compiled
           -# inputs to the examples are taken from the \c ROSE/tutorial directory
           -# output generated from running each example is placed into the tutorial
             documentation. \n
     - \b ROSE \b HTML \b Reference: Intermediate Representation (IR) documentation (these web pages) \n
           This web documentation presents the detail interfaces for each IR nodes
           (documentation generated by Doxygen).
           The ROSE HTML Reference documentation is found in \c ROSE/docs/Rose directory
           and is only available as html documentation (postscript would be prohibatively
           large and unwieldy). The ROSE HTML Reference can also be found at (link to main
           web page): \n
            <a href="./main.html"> ROSE HTML Reference (html version only) </a>. \n
     - \b ROSE \b Email \b Lists \n
           We have three mailing lists for core developers (those who have write access to
           the internal repository), all developers (anyone who has write access to the
           internal or external repository) and all users of ROSE (respectively). They are: \n

           <a href="https://mailman.nersc.gov/mailman/listinfo/rose-core"> https://mailman.nersc.gov/mailman/listinfo/rose-core </a> \n
