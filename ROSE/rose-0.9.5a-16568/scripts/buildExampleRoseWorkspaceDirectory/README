This is an internal workspace for the development of ROSE
projects as part of initial development. 

Two step build of ROSE specific workspace

1) Build command:
./build --srcpath /home/dquinlan/ROSE/git-dq-main-rc

2) Configure command (using the local configure use the same options as 
used to build the version of ROSE installed in the prefix directory):
   /home/dquinlan/ROSE/backstroke/configure --with-ROSE_LONG_MAKE_CHECK_RULE=yes --with-CXX_DEBUG=-g --with-C_DEBUG=-g --with-CXX_WARNINGS=-Wall --prefix=/home/dquinlan/ROSE/ROSE_CompileTree/git_LINUX-64bit-4.2.4-dq-main-rc_install --with-boost=/home/dquinlan/local/boost_1_37_0.gxx-4.2.4
3) To cleanup the source tree after running build run:
   rm -rf aclocal.m4 autom4te.cache configure internal_rose_config.h.in libltdl Makefile.in rose_workspace_config.h.in stamp-h1.in stamp-h.in

Notes about directories and files:
**********************************

1) Information about files:
   build
       This is a copy of the ROSE build script modified slightly to
       reference the ROSE/config and ROSE/acmacro directories.
       Later this file might be used as is an optionally take
       the directory location of the config and acmaros directories
       (as a command line option).

   configure.ac
       This is as simple of a autoconf/automake support example
       as possible.  This work should the use of ROSE to define
       projects outside of ROSE.


2) Information about directories:
   config 
       This directory has shell scripts required as part of the build process.


*******************************
Notes about the autoconf build:
*******************************

   1) The reorganization of the macro calls in configure.ac and ROSE/configure.in
permit a much simpler configure.ac file, but there are a number of things that
are tested for the workspace which don't make since and can be avoided:
     a. The setup on the include-staging directory (backend compiler specific 
        include files).  This has been eliminated by building two macros and
        calling the setup of the backend compiler specific include files only 
        in ROSE/configure.in (and not in the workspace/configure.ac).
     b. The generation of the compiler backend names.

Using make install to update ROSE can likely be spead up by avoiding
the relink that libtool does.  More information is available at:
