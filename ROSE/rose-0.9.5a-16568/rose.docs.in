\section IntroductionTag Introduction to ROSE

   ROSE is a tool for building source-to-source translators (sometimes confused 
with a preprocessor which is generally less sophisticated internally).  ROSE is
particularly useful in building custom tools that operate on source code for 
C, C99, C++, F77, F90, \& F2003. Fortran support is currently in development as 
a result of collaboration with Los Alamos National Laboratory to use their version 
of the Open Fortran Parser (OFP).  Our use of ROSE 
is focused on the development of optimizing source-to-source tools to support 
development of large scale scientific applications (applications typically about 
one million lines of code in size).

\section DocumentationTag ROSE Supporting Documentation

   This Doxygen generated documentation serves as an html reference to classes within the
   ROSE source code.   There are three forms of documentation for ROSE (two of which are
   available in both postscript and html), more information can be found at: \n
   \ref AvailableDocumentation.

\subsection ROSE_WebSite ROSE Web Site
     The ROSE Web Site will ultimately be an alternative location to get more information
     about the ROSE project. Built in 2005, it has been slow to evolve since we wanted to 
     keep a low profile as long as possible while we focused on robustness issues within
     the ROSE project and infrastructure. \n

          Versions of ROSE documentation (made accessable for debugging only): \n

\subsection dummyC ROSE Web Reference (this document)
    The ROSE Web Reference documents the classes representing the Intermediate
    Representation (IR) used in ROSE. The IR we use is derived from Sage++ and SageII
    and is internally refered to as SageIII (with permission from the original authors of
    Sage++ and SageII). \n

\subsection dummyD ROSE Email List
    We have three mailing lists for core developers (those who have write access to
    the internal repository), all developers (anyone who has write access to the
    internal or external repository) and all users of ROSE (respectively). They are: \n
    (rose-core *at* nersc *dot* gov), web interface: 
    <a href="https://mailman.nersc.gov/mailman/listinfo/rose-core"> https://mailman.nersc.gov/mailman/listinfo/rose-core </a> \n
    (rose-developer *at* nersc *dot* gov), web interface:

    Note that this information is available in the following files:
    rose.docs.in (this file, doxygen format), AvailableDocumentation.docs.in (doxygen format), 
    installRose.tex (LaTeX format), and developersAppendix.tex (LaTeX format).

\subsection RosePublications ROSE Publications
    ROSE is a research project which emphasises publication about the new technologies
    that we are developing, every often as part of external collaborations.  Publications
    specific to the ROSE project can be found at the main ROSE web page.

\section DownLoadInstructions ROSE Download Instructions

    ROSE is an open source project. The ROSE project is publically release via the
    outreach.scidac.gov web site (which hosts the main ROSE web page).

\section RoseRelatedWork Related Work & Background Material

    For more information about related work and background material \ref ProjectRelatedWorkPage.

   There are two levels of documentation: user level and developer level. 
      -# The user level documentation documents only the interfaces that are 
         important to the use of ROSE to build translators and express 
         transformations within them.
      -# The developer level documentation documents all classes, data members, 
         and member functions (public, protected, and private).

\section dummy1 Download Instructions

   ROSE is not presently released. However, we have made versions available to 
a limited number of collaborators.

\section Documentation

   Documentation is becoming available ... (please come back later)

\section dummy2 What is ROSE?

   ROSE is a tool for building source-to-source translators (sometimes confused 
with a preprocessors).  Specifically we are focused on translators that will use 
the semantics of user defined abstractions to provide additional information which 
can be used to optimize the performance of scientific applications.

\subsection dummy3 Target Audience

    There is a distinct and growing vacuum of compiler infrastructure, numerous tools
and optimizations are possible but the infrastructure is unavailable for commonly 
used languages (C, C++, FORTRAN, etc.). Our target audience is library and tool 
developers, people who don't have a compiler background but require mechanisms for
dealing with application codes. In doing this work we open up the compiler to the world ...
