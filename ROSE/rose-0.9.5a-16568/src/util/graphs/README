This is a graph library from Qing Yi's work which is not 
documented and many people have had trouble using.  Although
used in Qing's work it is not clear if it should be used by 
external users. 

(DQ: 5/26/2007): These comments are time sensitive.
   The subject of graph libraries for use in ROSE remains
a subject under investigation.  Several users have used their
own small graph libraries and they are included in ROSE.
