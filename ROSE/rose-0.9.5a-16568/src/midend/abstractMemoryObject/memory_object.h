/*!
 * An interface to represent all memory locations as a set of abstract objects.
 * Greg Bronevetsky drafted the original design document, with some help from me.
 *
 * It is part of the work to support the Compiled MPI project 
 *
 *  Goal: We only define interfaces and abstract implementation.
 *        Any particular instantiation should provide more details.
