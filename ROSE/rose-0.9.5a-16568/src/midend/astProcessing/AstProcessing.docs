     \brief This is the AST Processing Mechanism for traversing the AST and computing attributes.

     The AST Processing Mechanism allows to traverse the AST and to compute inherited and synthesized attributes.
     There exist 4 different interfaces:\n
          -# SimpleProcessing provides a pre- and postorder traversal of the AST. The user needs to implement one visit function.
          -# The TopDownProcessing - provides the computation of inherited attributes using a pre-order traversal.
          -# The BottomUpProcessing - provides the computation of synthesized attributes using a post-order traversal.
          -# The BottomUpTopDownProcessing - provides the computation of inherited and synthesized attributes.

     The classes have pure virtual functions. You must inherit and implement the required methods.

     \brief Attribute Evaluator for inherited attributes

     This class allows to compute inherited attributes on the AST. It requires
     an inherited attribute type as a template parameter and the implementation of
     the function evaluateInheritedAttribute. This function is invoked in pre-order while the AST is traversed.
     It can be used for passing context information down the AST.

 /*! \class AstBottomUpProcessing AstProcessing.h

     \brief Attribute Evaluator for synthesized attributes


     This class allows to compute synthesized attributes on the AST. It requires
     a synthesized attribute type as a template parameter and the implementation of
     the function evaluateSynthesizedAttribute. This function is invoked in post-order while the AST is traversed.
     It can be used for passing information up the AST and for computing a synthesized attribute at each node based on the results
     of its children in the AST.

     Initialization of synthesized attributes is necessary for values which represent results of non-existent nodes (= null pointers in the AST)
     or skipped nodes (e.g. traverseWithingFile skips all nodes which do not represent the same file as from where the evaluation of attributes started).
     -# Class as synthesized attribute type. The default constructor is sufficient to initialize the object representing an attribute value. 
     -# Primitive type as synthesized attribute type (e.g. int, bool, etc.). The method defaultSynthesizedAttribute must be implemented to initialize the
     synthesized attribute. This function is automatically called during attribute evaluation whenever necessary.

     \internal This class is derived from the SgTreeTraversal class.

 /*! \class AstTopDownBottomUpProcessing AstProcessing.h
     \ingroup AstProcessingClasses

     \brief Attribute Evaluator for inherited and synthesized attributes.

     In general, this class combines the classes TopDownProcessing and BottomUpProcessing and also allows to use the inherited attribute of a node
     in the computation of the synthesized attribute at the same node.\n

     This class allows to compute inherited and synthesized attributes on the AST. It requires
     an inherited attribute type and a synthesized attribute type as a template parameter and the implementation of
     the function evaluateInheritedAttribute and
     evaluateSynthesizedAttribute. The function
     evaluateInheritedAttribute is invoked in pre-order, the function
     evaluateSynthesizedAttribute is invoked in post-order while the
     AST is traversed. The function evaluateSynthesizedAttribute gets
     as additional parameter the inheritedAttribute value which is computed at the respective node. It
     can be used to make the computation of the synthesized attribute at a node
     dependent on the value of the inherited attribute of the same
     node. \n

     \internal This class is derived from the SgTreeTraversal class.

 /*! \class AstAttributeMechanism AstAttributeMechanism.h

     \brief This mechanism provides capabilities to define a mapping from strings to AstAttributes. An instance of this class is accessible at each ROSE AST node in the data member 'attribute'.


     Each node of the ROSE AST contains an AstAttributeMechanism,
     accessible as data member 'attribute'. Using this mechnism attributes can be attached to AST nodes.\n
     example: class MyAstAttribute : public AstAttribute { public: MyAstAttribute(int v):val(v){} ... private: int val; };\n
              node->attribute.add("myattribute1",new MyAstAttribute(5));\n

 /*! \class AstAttribute AstAttributeMechanism.h

     \brief Base class for attributes that can be attached to AST nodes using the attribute mechanism in each AST node.

     
     Objects of class AstAttribute can be be attached to ROSE AST
     nodes. An attribute must be a subclass of AstAttribute.  Each
     node of the ROSE AST contains an AstAttributeMechanism,
     accessible as data member 'attribute'. Using this mechnism attributes can be attached to AST nodes.\n
     example: class MyAstAttribute : public AstAttribute { public: MyAstAttribute(int v):val(v){} ... private: int val; };\n
              node->attribute.add("myattribute1",new MyAstAttribute(5));\n
              MyAstAttribute* accessexample = node->attribute["myattribute1"];\n

 /*! \class Ast Ast.h

     \brief Class that provides an iterator for the ROSE AST.

     usage: Ast x(mystartnode); for(Ast::iterator i=x.begin();i!=x.end();x++) { MYCODE } \n

     The iterator refers to pointers of AST nodes, it never holds a null-pointer of the
     traversed tree.

     \todo (DQ 2/1/2006): Could we please change the name of this class, it is not an AST.
