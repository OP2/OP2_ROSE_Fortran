Description of the Runtime system used for the ROSE-RTED support.

Most managers (StackManager, PointerManager, and matbe a few others
use the MemoryManager.


To support Race Detection, the functions
MemoryManager::checkRead() and MemoryManager::checkWrite()
would have to be modified to keep track of chains of reads and
writes in each thread of execution.  The data strcutures for the 
read/write chains would have to be added (if required, likely
for debugging or providing better information about detected 
race conditions).

Note that all pointers are assumed to be of size equal to "void*".
