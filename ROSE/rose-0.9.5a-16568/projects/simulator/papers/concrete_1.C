/* Demonstrates how to perform concrete analysis on the "updcrc" function.  We allow the specimen (compiled from
 * gzip_sample_1.c) to run until main() is entered, then allocate some memory, initialize it with a string, and analyze the
 * updcrc() function to obtain an output value.
 *
 * Since this is a concrete analysis, most of it could be done in GDB as well.  difficult to adjust memory
 * mapping of the specimen in GDB.
 *
 * Documentation can be found by running:
 *    $ doxygen RSIM.dxy
 *    $ $WEB_BROWSER docs/html/index.html
