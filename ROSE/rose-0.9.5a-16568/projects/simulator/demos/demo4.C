/* Demonstrates how to perform sign analysis in tandem with symbolic analysis.
 *
 * Run this demo like this:
 *   $ demo4 ./demo4input
 *
 * Documentation can be found by running:
 *    $ doxygen RSIM.dxy
 *    $ $WEB_BROWSER docs/html/index.html
 *
 *
 *
 * As mentioned in an earler demo, the SignAnalysisExample must be run in tandem with some other analysis in order to figure
 * out which instructions to process -- the sign analysis itself does not calculate enough information to know the address of
 * the next instruction.  The earlier demo ran the sign analysis in synchrony with the simulator itself, which was a bit
 * useless since we could just get signs by consulting the concrete values in the simulators state.
 *
 * This demo does sign analysis over a function and uses symbolic analysis to figure out instruction addresses.  It's also a
 * bit useless because the signs can be discovered by running an SMT solver.  However, it demonstrates how one analysis can
 * drive another analysis.
 *
 * Here's what we do:
 *
 * 1. Allow the specimen to execute up to a certain point in order to resolve dynamic linking.  This demo parses the ELF file
 *    to find the address of "main" and stops when it is reached.  By executing to main(), we allow the dynamic linker to run,
 *    giving us more information about the executable.
 *
 * 2. When main is reached, we will do some symbolic analysis on the "payload" function.  This function, which normally isn't
 *    called, takes one integer argument and calculates an integer result.  Our analysis gives an expression for the result in
 *    terms of the (unknown) input argument.  In other words, an expression defining the function.
 *
 * 3. As the symbolic analysis discovers the control flow path, instructions on that path are fed into the sign analysis.  When
 *    the symbolic analysis can no longer find a unique control flow path, the analysis stops.  For simple enough functions,
 *    this will happen at the end of the function because we didn't give the analysis a return address.
