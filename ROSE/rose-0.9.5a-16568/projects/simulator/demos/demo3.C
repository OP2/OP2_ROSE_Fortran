/* Demonstrates how to perform symbolic analysis on a function that isn't called.
 *
 * Run this demo like this:
 *     $ demo3 ./demo3input
 *
 * Documentation can be found by running:
 *    $ doxygen RSIM.dxy
 *    $ $WEB_BROWSER docs/html/index.html
 *
 *
 * This demo does the following:
 *
 * 1. Allow the specimen to execute up to a certain point in order to resolve dynamic linking.  This demo parses the ELF file
 *    to find the address of "main" and stops when it is reached.  By executing to main(), we allow the dynamic linker to run,
 *    giving us more information about the executable.
 *
 * 2. When main is reached, we will do some symbolic analysis on the "payload" function.  This function, which normally isn't
 *    called, takes one integer argument and calculates an integer result.  Our analysis gives an expression for the result in
 *    terms of the (unknown) input argument.  In other words, an expression defining the function.
 *
 * 3. Using the result from the previous step, try to determine if there's any argument that would result in a particular
 *    return value.  E.g., find N satisfying payload(N)==2067789406.
