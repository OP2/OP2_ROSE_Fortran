This project is used to draw a graph which show include relationship of headers in a given directory. If header A includes header B directly, there will be a directed edge from A node to B node. The output is a DOT file.

The usage is like this:
headerFilesGraphGenerator <target directory> [-I <include directory>]

Assume the ROSE include directory is $(ROSE_DIR)/include. You can get a graph which shows the include relationship among headers in that directory.

./headerFilesGraphGenerator $(ROSE_DIR)/include -I $(ROSE_DIR)/include

The output is a dot files which you have to open using a tool like zgrviewer.
