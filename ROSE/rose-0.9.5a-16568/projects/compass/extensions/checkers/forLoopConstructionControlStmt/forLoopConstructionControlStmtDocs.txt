\section{For Loop Construction Control Stmt}

\label{ForLoopConstructionControlStmt::overview}

\quote{Namespace: \texttt{ForLoopConstructionControlStmt}}

\subsection{Introduction}
Unlike while loop constructs, non-control statements in for loop constructors
tend to appear beyond the test expression. Often these statements may be moved
in to the body of the for loop construct easily and results in greater clarity
in the for loop construction code. Taken from ``LLNL ALE3D'', sec 6.1.

%Give an exact reference to the pattern in the literature.
%Here is the example:
%The reference for this checker is: H. Sutter, A. Alexandrescu:
%``C++ Coding Standards'', Item 28: ``Prefer the canonical form ++ and --. 
%Prefer calling the prefix forms''.

\subsection{Parameter Requirements}
This checker takes no parameters and inputs source file.

\subsection{Implementation}
This pattern is checked using a simple AST traversal that seeks out for loop
statement constructs. Once a for loop is found the for loop construction block,
e.g. for( ; ; ) is string searched for instances of the comma operator 
that indicates the use of non-control expressions in for loop construction code.

\subsection{Example of Failing Output Code}

%Examples of the patterns go here.

%If there is strange known behaviour, you can write a 
%subsection that describes that problem.
