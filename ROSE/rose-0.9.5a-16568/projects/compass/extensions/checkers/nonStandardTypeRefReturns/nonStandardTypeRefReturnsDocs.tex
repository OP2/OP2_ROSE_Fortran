\section{Non Standard Type Ref Returns}
\label{NonStandardTypeRefReturns::overview}
While it is cheaper to pass ints, longs, and such by value, passing
objects this way incurs significant expense due to the construction of
 temporary objects. The problem becomes more severe when inheritance
 is involved. Simulate pass-by-value by passing const references.

\subsection{Parameter Requirements}

%Write the Parameter specification here.
No parameters necessary.

\subsection{Implementation}

%Details of the implementation go here.
The return types to all functions are checked for base type in the
declaration.  If the base type is found to be a struct or a class, it
is then checked to ensure it is a reference.  If it is not, a
notification is raised.


\subsection{Non-Compliant Code Example}

% write your non-compliant code subsection

\begin{verbatim}


class incrediblyComplex
{
private:
//loads of members
}

incrediblyComplex justLooking()
{
incrediblyComplex *fullCopy = new incrediblyComplex();
return (*fullCopy);
}


\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Compliant Solution}

% write your compliant code subsection

\begin{verbatim}

class incrediblyComplex
{
private:
//loads of members
}

incrediblyComplex& justLooking()
{
incrediblyComplex *fullCopy = new incrediblyComplex();
return (*fullCopy);
}

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Mitigation Strategies}
\subsubsection{Static Analysis} 

Compliance with this rule can be checked using structural static analysis checkers using the following algorithm:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify function declaration
\item Check return for base type
\item if non-intrinsic type and not a reference, notify
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{References}
