              Revised BSD License (non-advertising clause)

This software is distributed under the revised Berkeley Software Distribution 
(BSD) license by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory LLNL (managed by the 
University of California).  The revised BSD license is the same as the original
BSD license, but without the famous advertising clause that was a problem 
historically (see www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html for details). Our goal
has been to select as liberal a license as possible for the ROSE project.
