This directory contains tests that use the tview testing tool 
to colorize the input source code and help us identify errors
in the source position information stored in the Sg_File_Info
object in the AST.

The "tview" tool has been written by Thomas Panas and is in 
ROSE/src/roseIndependentSupport/tview (see the README file there).
