subroutine foo()

     integer :: array_A
     integer :: array_C

   ! The dimension statement is not output since the dimension attribute 
   ! is used in the declaration for each array. Not clear if this is a 
   ! problem, I think it is equivalent code.
     dimension array_A(2,3), array_C(4,5)

end subroutine
