This directory contains fortran test codes from the gfortran test suit.

The test codes are menat to be run with -rose:skip_syntax_check
since many will fail with first processin in ROSE for syntax checking using
gfortran (version 4.2.4; but likely each version of gfortran would
behave differently).  In the Makefile.am are the lists of files
assigned to the varaibles:
   F90_TESTCODES_REQUIRED_TO_PASS
and
   F77_FIXED_FORMAT_TESTCODES_REQUIRED_TO_PASS
and defined to be a short and long list depending on the automake
conditional: ROSE_USE_LONG_MAKE_CHECK_RULE.
