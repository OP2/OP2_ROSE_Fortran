\label{astMerge::overview}

\section{Introduction}

   The AST merge support in ROSE is a mechanism to generate a
single binary file representing the AST for a whole program
that could consist of thousands of files.  A focus in this work 
has been on the scaling required to handle realistic large scale 
laboratory applications.



\section{Usage}
     See tutorial for an example.
