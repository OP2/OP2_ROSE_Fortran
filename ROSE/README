Note that configuration and building of ROSE requires the Boost libraries to be in your path

To configure and build do the following:

1) Create two directories
a) rose_build:  where the ROSE sources will be built.
b) rose_inst:  where the ROSE libraries and includes will be installed.

2) Run the configure command from the 'rose_build' directory with the following options:
--prefix=/path/to/rose_inst --with-boost=/path/to/boost --enable-cuda --enable-opencl --with-java --without-haskell --with-CXX_DEBUG=-g --with-CXX_OPTIMIZE=-O0

3) Run 'make'

4) Run 'make install'

See the ROSE documentation for more assistance.
