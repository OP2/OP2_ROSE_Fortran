/* Design rules:
 *   1. All public symbols in this file should use the "RTS_" prefix (ROSE Thread Support).
 *
 *   2. All constructs that have a user-supplied compound statement as a "body", have a matching "_END" macro.  For instance,
 *      RTS_MUTEX starts a mutual exclusion for a critical section, which ends with an RTS_MUTEX_END macro.  The END macros
 *      generally take no arguments.
 *
 *   3. Locally scoped symbols defined by the macros have names beginning with "RTS_". This is generally followed by the first
 *      letter of the rest of the macro name, a letter "s" or "p" for "shared" or "private", and an underscore.  For example,
 *      within the RTS_MUTEX macros, a private (non-shared) variable might be named "RTS_Mp_mutex".
 *
 *   4. Constructs that allow a user-supplied compound statement as a "body" should allow the body to "break" or "throw". Both
 *      forms of premature exit should behave as if the body executed to completion (except throw will throw the exception
 *      again automatically).
 *
 *   5. New functionality shall have types, constants, and functions reminiscent of the POSIX threads interface, but whose
 *      names begin with "RTS_" rather than "pthread_".

/** Layers where syncrhonization primitives are defined.
 *
 *  When a thread intends to acquire multiple locks at a time, it must acquire those locks in a particular order to prevent
 *  deadlock.  Deadlock can occur when thread 1 attempts to acquire lock A and then B, while thread 2 attempts to acquire lock
 *  B and then A.  By defining every lock to belong to a particular software layer, we can impose a partial ordering on the
 *  locks and enforce the requirement that a thread obtain locks in that order.  To use the previous example, if lock A belongs
 *  to layer X and lock B to layer Y, then a rule that says "locks of layer X must be acquired before locks of layer Y when
 *  attempting to acquire both at once" would be sufficient to prevent deadlock.  This mechanism makes no attempt to define an
 *  acquisition order for locks of the same layer (at least not at this time).
 *
 *  When a thread acquires locks from more than one layer at a time, they must be acquired in descending order by layer (they
 *  can be released in any order).  If a thread attempts to aquire a lock whose layer is greater than the minimum layer for
 *  which it already holds a lock, then an error message is emitted and the process aborts.
 *
 *  New layers can be added to this enum and the RTS_LAYER_NLAYERS constant can be increased if necessary.  When a layer's
 *  number is changed, all of ROSE must be recompiled.  The constant name is used in error messages. Names ending with "_CLASS"
 *  refer to synchronization primities that are class data members (or global), while those ending with "_OBJ" belong to a
 *  particular object.
 *
 *  Layer zero is special and is the default layer for all syncronization primitives not explicitly associated with any layer.
 *  Locks in layer zero can be acquired in any order without generating an error message (so silent deadlock is a distinct
 *  possibility). */

/** Protect a critical section with a read-write lock.
 *
 *  These macros should be used within ROSE whenever we need to protect a critical section among two kinds of access: reading
 *  and writing.
 *
 *  This construct allows at most one thread to hold a write lock, or multiple threads to hold read locks.  Write locks are
 *  granted only when no other thread holds a read or write lock, and a request for a write lock blocks (becomes pending) if
 *  the lock cannot be granted.  Read locks are granted only when no write lock is already granted to another thread, and no
 *  write lock is pending.
 *
 *  Like POSIX read-write locks, RTS_rwlock_t allows a single thread to obtain multiple read locks recursively. Unlike POSIX
 *  read-write locks, RTS_rwlock_t also allows the following:
 *
 *  <ul>
 *    <li>A lock (read or write) is granted to a thread which already holds a write lock.  The POSIX implementation deadlocks
 *        in this situation.  This feature is useful in ROSE when a read-write lock guards access to data members of an object,
 *        and the object methods can be invoked recursively.</li>
 *    <li>The RTS_rwlock_unlock() function releases locks in the reverse order they were granted and should only be called by
 *        the thread to which the lock was granted.</li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  In particular, this implementation does not allow a thread which holds only read locks to be granted a write lock (i.e., no
 *  lock upgrading). Like POSIX read-write locks, this situation will lead to deadlock.
 *
 *  The RTS_READ macro should be paired with an RTS_READ_END macro; the RTS_WRITE macro should be paired with an RTS_WRITE_END
 *  macro.  The RTS_RWLOCK macro is a generalization of RTS_READ and RTS_WRITE where its second argument is either the word
 *  "rdlock" or "wrlock", respectively. It should be paired with an RTS_RWLOCK_END macro.
 *
 *  The critical section may exit only via "break" statement, throwing an exception, or falling through the end.  Exceptions
 *  thrown by the critical section will release the lock before rethrowing the exception.
 *
 *  A simple example demonstrating how locks can be obtained recursively.  Any number of threads can be operating on a single,
 *  common object concurrently and each of the four defined operations remains atomic.

 *******************************************************************************************************************************/


/** Initializer synchronization.
 *
 *  Sometimes we want a critical section to be executed only by the first thread to call the function and all other threads
 *  that might call the same function should block until the first caller completes.  These macros can be used for that
 *  purpose.
 *
 *  The MUTEX is briefly locked to inspect the state of initilization, and then unlocked before the user-supplied body is
 *  executed.  The user is permitted to obtain the mutex lock again in the body if desired, although this is only necessary if
 *  other code paths (outside the RTS_INIT construct) might interfere with the body.
 *
 *  If ALLOW_RECURSION is true, then a recursive call from the body will jump over the RTS_INIT construct without doing
 *  anything (other than briefly obtaining the mutex lock to inspect the state of initialization). Otherwise a recursive call
 *  from the body is considered a logic error and the process will be aborted. For convenience, we define two additional
 *  macros, RTS_INIT_RECURSIVE and RTS_INIT_NONRECURSIVE, which may be used in place of the two-argument RTS_INIT macro.
 *
 *  The user-supplied body may exit prematurely either by a "break" statement or by throwing an exception.  In either case, the
 *  initialization is assumed to have completed and the body will not be executed by any other future call.  Any other kind of
 *  premature exit from the body (return, goto, longjmp, etc) results in undefined behavior.
 *
 *  Example code. Consider a class method which is responsible for one-time initialization of certain class data
 *  structures. This initialization function is called by nearly every other method in the class, and therefore anything that
 *  the initialization function does might result in a recursive call to the initializer.

/** Provides a locked context for messaging.  Normal message output methods do not require locking since they perform the
 *  locking implicitly.  However, one needs to provide some kind of customized output not otherwise possible, a lock needs to
 *  be obtained while that output is produced. See RTS_Messsage::lock() for details.
 *
 *  The RTS_MESSAGE macro takes an RTS_Message object as an argument, and locks it until the corresponding RTS_MESSAGE_END
 *  macro. The RTS_MESSAGE_END macro takes one argument: a Boolean expression which evaluates to true if no output was produced
 *  or the output ended with a line-feed.
 *
 *  The body between the RTS_MESSAGE and RTS_MESSAGE_END macro should not exit non-locally except by "break" or throwing an
 *  exception, both of which release the lock.
 *
 *  Example:
 *
 *  @code
 *  RTS_Message mesg(stderr, NULL);
 *  RTS_MESSAGE(mesg) {
 *     for (size_t i=0; i<n; i++) {
 *         fprintf(stderr, "    arg(%d) = %d\n", i, arg[i]);
 *     }
 *  } RTS_MESSAGE_END(true);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Note that the previous example could have more easily been obtained with the following, except that in a multi-threaded
 *  application another thread might interject its own output between these lines.
 *  @code
