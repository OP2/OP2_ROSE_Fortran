\subsection configure Configure Options
   To build RoseQtWidgets you have to configure ROSE with the following options:
    - \c  --with-roseQt   (depends on Qt4.5)
    - \c  --with-dwarf    (to use the AsmToSourceMapper)

\subsection qtdesigner_integration   Qt-Designer Integration

    In order to use the ROSE-widgets in QtDesigner, the QtDesignerPlugins-library  has to
    be copied or symlinked  into the Qt-Plugins directory:

    \verbatim
     cp  roseInstallDir/lib/libQtDesignerPlugins.so \
         qtinstallpath/qtplugins/designer/
    \endverbatim

    The default Qt-Plugin path is  \em QtInstallationFolder/qtplugins . If you do not have
    write access to that, it's possible to create a new one and set the environment
    variable QT_PLUGIN_PATH accordingly. \n
    \b Important: the env-variable has to point to the \em qtplugins folder not to the \em designer folder.
