    /** Class for calculating dominance on control flow graphs.
     *
     *  Block D "dominates" block I if every possible execution path from the function entry block to block I includes block
     *  D. Note that "dominates" is reflexive; we say D "strictly dominates" I if D dominates I and D!=I.  The "dominates"
     *  relationship is also transitive and antisymmetric.  Furthermore, block D is an "immediate dominator" of block I if D
     *  dominates I and there does not exist a block C (C!=D and C!=I) for which D dominates C and C dominates I.
     *
     *  ROSE tracks dominance via a single block pointer within each block, which can be obtained by
     *  SgAsmBlock::get_immediate_dominator().  Although these pointers can also be explicitly modifed with
     *  SgAsmBlock::set_immediate_dominator(), one normally uses the Dominance class to do this.
     *
     *  Dominance information is represented three ways:
     *  <ol>
     *    <li>Within the AST: The SgAsmBlock::get_dominators() returns a list of all dominators (or all strict dominators) for
     *        a given node by following the immediate dominator pointers stored in the AST.</li>
     *    <li>As a boost graph:  The vertices of the graph point to basic blocks (SgAsmBlock); the edges flow to subordinate
     *        blocks from their immediate dominator, and form a tree.  Note that the direction of edges is opposite that
     *        stored in the AST&mdash;this is intentional since many dominance anlyses use this direction. Methods producing
     *        or operating on this representation usually have "graph" as part of their name.</li>
     *    <li>As a vector:  Since every block has zero or one immediate dominators, the immediate dominance relation can be
     *        represented as a map from suborindate block to immediate dominator block.  The dominance relationship is
     *        calculated from a control flow graph (CFG) whose vertex descriptors are integers, so we use those integers
     *        as indices into the vector. The values stored in the vector are also CFG vertex descriptors.  Methods producing
     *        or operating on this representation usually have "map" as part of their name.</li>
     *  </ol>
     *
     *  The Dominance class provides two forms for most methods: one form in which the result is returned by reference, and one
     *  form in which the result is returned by value.  The return-by-reference functions are slightly faster since they don't
     *  require the result to be copied.
     *
     *  @section BinaryDominance_Ex1 Example
     *
     *  This example shows one way to initialize the SgAsmBlock::get_immediate_dominator() information for an entire AST.  We
     *  use an AST traversal to find the function nodes (SgAsmFunctionDeclaration), and for each function we calculate that
     *  function's control flow graph, and use the control flow graph to calculate the dominance graph.  We then clear all
     *  previous immediate dominator pointers in the function, and re-initialize them with the dominance graph.  The reason we
     *  first clear the AST is because apply_to_ast() only initializes the blocks which have dominators; if we didn't clear the
     *  AST then some of the blocks might have stale data.
     *
     *  Control flow graphs and dominance graphs are created with methods of a control flow and dominance class, respectively.
     *  The reason for this extra class is to hold various properties that might affect how the graphs are created, such as
     *  whether we want a debug trace of the creation process (the commented out line).

        /** A dominance graph.
         *
         *  A dominance graph (DG) is a Boost graph whose vertex descriptors are integers and whose vertices point to
         *  SgAsmBlock nodes in the AST (via the boost::vertex_name property).  Graph edges represent dominance relationships
         *  between the vertices.  The particular relationship varies depending on the method by which the graph was built. For
         *  example, build_idom_graph() results in a graph whose edge (U,V) indicates that U is the immediate dominator of V,
         *  while build_sdom_graph() results in a graph whose edge (U,V) indicates that U is any strict dominator of V.
         *
         *  Note that the edges of the graph are reversed from those stored in the AST.  In the AST each block points to its
         *  immediate dominator, while in the graph each block has edges going to the blocks which it dominates.  We do it this
         *  way because:
         *  <ul>
         *    <li>it's more succinct to store only the immediate dominator pointers in the AST, and</li>
         *    <li>most dominance graph algorithms use the edges in the direction we've made them, and</li>
         *    <li>it's easy to reverse the graph via the boost::reverse_graph if necessary, and</li>
         *    <li>having two directions natively stored gives more flexibility to algorithm writers.</li>
         *  </ul>
         *
         *  When a dominance graph is built from a control flow graph, the vertices of the dominance graph will correspond with
         *  the vertices of the control flow graph.  That is, vertex V in the dominance graph points to the same basic block as
         *  vertex V in the control flow graph.
