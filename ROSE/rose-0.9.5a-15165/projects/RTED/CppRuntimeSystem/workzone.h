/// \details multiple readers are constantly operating in a workzone; a
///          participant intending an unsafe operation raises a
///          signal (beginExperiment), acquires a write lock (rw) on the workzone,
///          and waits until the workzone is clear (rw.readers == 0). readers
///          noticing the signal (checked by staySafe) exit the lab and
///          wait in a safe zone (staySafe) until the experiment is over
///          (endExperiment). Then all participants return to operate
///          concurrently.
///          RTED for UPC uses this scheme to protect threads from race
///          conditions on upc_free and violation output. As long as all
///          threads perform heap acquisitions, heap reads, and heap writes,
///          every thread can operate concurrently in the work zone; only
///          upc_frees (and uninterrupted console output) require other threads
///          to exit the workzone and wait until the operation has finished.
