/**
 * @brief Main API of the runtimesystem.  Provides direct and indirect access to
 * PointerManager, MemoryManager, StackManager, CStdLibManager, and FileManager.
 * Also provides access to TypeSystem.
 *
 * RuntimeSystem is responsible for keeping track of all variable allocations,
 * memory and file operations.  Although most of the implementation exists in
 * the various managers, the primary user-visible API is provided by this class.
 *
 * There a two classes of functions:
 *      - Register Functions:   have to be called when specific memory operations
 *                              are called in instrumented code especially
 *                              (de-)allocations, and writes to memory
 *      - Check Functions:      check if certain memory allocations are safe/valid
 *
 * Features of RuntimeSystem include:
 *      - @b Checking @b memory @b reads.
 *              Reads can be checked to ensure memory is readable (i.e. an
 *              address refers to allocated memory), initialized, and
 *              type-consistent.
 *      - @b Checking @b memory @b writes.
 *              Writes can be checked to ensure memory is allocated, and that
 *              the write is type-consistent (e.g. ensuring that one doesn't
 *              write a float to a memory location to which one had previously
 *              written an int).
 *      - @b Checking @b pointer @b manipulations.
 *              Pointer increments can be checked to ensure that they stay
 *              within the same sort of memory.  The canonical example is array
 *              bounds checking.
 *              @n@n
 *              Memory leaks can be checked at pointer assignment as well.  If
 *              some pointer φ refers to some allocated memory μ and is assigned
 *              to some other address, and no other pointer points to μ, an
 *              error can be raised.  This has false positives in the sense that
 *              one might be able to reliably compute the address of a memory
 *              location without having a pointer to that location.
 *              @n
 *      - @b Stack @b Management.
 *              The runtime system can track stack variables and automatically
 *              deallocate them (and check for corresponding memory leaks) when
 *              stack frames are removed.
 *      - @b Miscellaneous
 *              The runtime system can also verify function signatures (only
 *              applicable to C) and check for consistent memory
 *              allocation/deallocation (e.g. raising an exception if memory
 *              allocated with @c malloc is freed with @c delete).
 *
 * @remarks RuntimeSystem provides an API for managing pointers, checking for
 * memory leaks and so on.  There are some important implementation details,
 * namely:
 *      -#  An assumption is made that all pointers are of the same size
 *          (specifically, @c sizeof(void*)).
 *      -#  That size is determined when the @em RuntimeSystem is compiled.
 *
 * Singleton
 *
 * \note the constness on functions indicates whether the state of the system
 *       (e.g., MemoryManager, PointerManager, etc. is changed)
 *       This does *NOT* include changes to the violation reporting system.
 *       I.e., One could argue that program termination (or error reporting)
 *             on a singleton changes the state of the system. We do not
 *             follow such a strict interpretation. Merely the constness
 *             serves as hint when we need to communicate updates to
 *             concurrent runtime systems (for UPC). (\pp)
