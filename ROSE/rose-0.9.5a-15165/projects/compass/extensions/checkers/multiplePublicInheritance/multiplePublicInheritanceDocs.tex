\section{Multiple Public Inheritance}
\label{MultiplePublicInheritance::overview}

Multiple inheritance in C++ can give rise to very complicated issues, in
particular when a class has several public superclasses; in contrast, having a
single public superclass and several private ones (only inheriting code from
these, but not public interfaces) can be much more controllable. This checker
ensures that no class has more than one public superclass, while not
prohibiting multiple inheritance in general.

\subsection{Parameter Requirements}

This checker does not require any parameters.

\subsection{Non-Compliant Code Example}

\begin{verbatim}
// Dummy classes, the first of which is designed to be used as a base class
// from which one inherits an interface, the second designed to be used as a
// base class from which one only inherits an implementation.
class Interface { /* ... */ };
class Implementation { /* ... */ };

// not OK: multiple public base classes
class A: public Interface, public Implementation
{
    /* ... */
};
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Compliant Solution}

\begin{verbatim}
class Interface { /* ... */ };
class Implementation { /* ... */ };

// OK: only one public base class, others may be non-public
class B: public Interface, private Implementation
{
    /* ... */
};
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Mitigation Strategies}
\subsubsection{Static Analysis} 

Compliance with this rule can be checked using structural static analysis checkers using the following algorithm:

\begin{enumerate}
\item For each class definition, inspect the list of inheritances. If more
than one base class is listed as public, emit a diagnostic.
\end{enumerate}
