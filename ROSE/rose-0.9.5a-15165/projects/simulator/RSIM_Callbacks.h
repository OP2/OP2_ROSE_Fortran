/** Set of callbacks.  Callbacks are user-supplied objects whose operator() is invoked at particular points during a
 *  simulation.  The set of callbacks is organized into lists and all callbacks present on a list are invoked at the desired
 *  time.  The arguments for the callback depend on the kind of callback, but always include a boolean value, which is the
 *  return value of the previous callback on the list (or related list), or true for the first callback.
 *
 *  Callbacks are associated with threads, processes, or the simulator as a whole.  When a new thread is created its callbacks
 *  are initialized from the process; and when a new process is created its callbacks are initialized from the simulator.  When
 *  a callback list is copied, each callback's clone() method is invoked to generate the new copy.  Since threads and processes
 *  are never deleted (at least not until the simulator is deleted), their callback lists are never deleted.  Removal of a
 *  callback from a list also does not delete the callback. Therefore it's safe for the clone() method to be a no-op, simply
 *  returning a pointer to the original object.
 *
 *  Callbacks are called in the order they were added to the list. See the various "call_*" methods for details.  Any callback
 *  is allowed to modify the lists in the RSIM_Callbacks object, and these changes don't affect which callbacks are made nor
 *  the order in which they're made until the next invocation of a "call_*" method.
 *
 *  Callbacks may be made from multiple threads concurrently, so all callbacks should be thread safe.  Generally speaking, one
 *  should not assume that any particular mutexes or read-write locks are held when the callback is invoked.  All of the
 *  RSIM_Callbacks methods are thread safe.
 *
 *  @section Example1 Example:  Disassembling a dynamically linked binary
 *
 *  Binary executables are often dynamically linked, wherein the main binary contains only stubs for dynamic functions and
 *  those functions' text and data are loaded into process memory and linked at run time.  Since most disassemblers don't
 *  perform these steps when disassembling, they don't disassemble the dynamic libraries.  In fact, under Linux, the dynamic
 *  linker is itself a dynamic library which is loaded into the process address space by the kernel, which then starts
 *  execution at the linker's entry point.  Since the simulator makes the original entry point (OEP) available to the user, we
 *  can simply allow the specimen executable to be simulated until we reach the OEP, and then invoke the ROSE disassembler on
 *  the specimen memory map.
 *
 *  What follows is a very simplistic example of disassembling memory when the OEP is reached.  The example callback is invoked
 *  before every instruction.  If the instruction address matches the OEP then the specimen's memory is disassembled (in a
 *  thread-safe manner) and the assembly is unparsed to the standard output stream.  The callback is then removed from the
 *  calling thread's callbacks (although it might still be called from other threads that try to execute at the OEP).
 *
 *  @code
 *  struct DisassembleAtOep: public RSIM_Callbacks::InsnCallback {
 *      // Share a single callback among the simulator, the process, and all threads.
 *      virtual DisassembleAtOep *clone() { return this; }
 *
 *      // The actual callback. See ROSE_Callbacks::List (in the ROSE documentation)
 *      // for why it's defined this way, particularly the Args argument.  The purpose
 *      // of the Boolean arg is described in ROSE_Callbacks::List::apply().
 *      virtual bool operator()(bool prev, const Args &args) {
 *          RSIM_Process *process = args.thread->get_process();
 *          if (process->get_ep_orig_va() == args.insn->get_address()) {
 *              // This thread is at the OEP.  Call the thread-safe disassembler.
 *              SgAsmBlock *block = process->disassemble();
 *
 *              // Output disassembled instructions, functions, etc.  See disassemble.C
 *              // in tests/roseTests/binaryTests for more sophisticated examples of
 *              // displaying instructions and other information using AsmUnparser.
 *              AsmUnparser().unparse(std::cout, block);
 *
 *              // Remove this callback from this thread. Also, by removing it from the
 *              // process we prevent subsequently created threads from incuring the
 *              // runtime overhead of invoking this callback on every instruction. Removal
 *              // is entirely optional.
 *              args.thread->get_callbacks().remove_insn_callback(RSIM_Callbacks::BEFORE, this);
 *              process->get_callbacks().remove_insn_callback(RSIM_Callbacks::BEFORE, this);
 *          }
 *          return prev;
 *      }
 *  };
 *
 *  // Register the callback to be called before every instruction.  Registering it
 *  // for the entire simulator will cause it to also be registered for the specimen's
 *  // process and threads when they are created later.
 *  RSIM_Simulator simulator;
 *  simulator.get_callbacks().add_insn_callback(RSIM_Callbacks::BEFORE, new DisassembleAtOep);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Continue by configuring the simulator, loading the specimen executable, activating the simulator, running the simulator,
 *  etc.  An example is provided on the RSIM main page (\ref index).
 *
 *  @section Example2 Example: Using the disassembler to trace functions
 *
 *  A side effect of calling RSIM_Process::disassemble() is that the resulting AST contains instruction nodes
 *  (SgAsmInstruction) whose grandparents are function nodes (SgAsmFunctionDeclaration).  We can use this fact to print the
 *  name of the function in which we're currently executing.
 *
 *  @code
 *  class ShowFunction: public RSIM_Callbacks::InsnCallback {
 *  public:
 *      // Share a single callback among the simulator, the process, and all threads.
 *      virtual ShowFunction *clone() { return this; }
 *
 *      // The actual callback.
 *      virtual bool operator()(bool prev, const Args &args) {
 *          SgAsmBlock *basic_block = isSgAsmBlock(args.insn->get_parent());
 *          SgAsmFunctionDeclaration *func = basic_block ?
 *                                           SageInterface::getEnclosingNode<SgAsmFunctionDeclaration>(basic_block) :
 *                                           NULL;
 *          if (func && func->get_name()!=name) {
 *              name = func->get_name();
 *              args.thread->tracing(TRACE_MISC)->mesg("in function \"%s\"", name.c_str());
 *          }
 *          return prev;
 *      }
 *
 *  private:
 *      std::string name;
 *  };
 * 
 *  sim.get_callbacks().add_insn_callback(RSIM_Callbacks::BEFORE, new ShowFunction);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  The output will be something along the following lines.  The "28129:1" means the main thread of process 28129. The floating
 *  point number which follows is the time in seconds since the start of the simulation.  The hexadecimal number is the address
 *  of the instruction that's about to be executed followed by an instruction counter in square brackets.  Our "in function"
 *  output appears, in this example, with system call tracing that contains the name of the system call, the system call number
 *  from <asm/unistd_32.h>, the arguments, and the return value.
