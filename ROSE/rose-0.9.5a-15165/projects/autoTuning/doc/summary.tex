\section{Summary}

   The work presented is ongoing work, and focused on the whole program empirical tuning
and the automation of all the required steps to make that work for realistic HPC applications
in C, C++, and Fortran.  
The work to has a few steps that are likely not so easy to fully
automate, namely the manipulation of the Makefiles and bash scripts that are required to support the empirical
tuning, but it is likely this can be simplified in the future.

The work presented is also immediately focused on providing an infrastructure for 
the empirical tuning and less on the empirical tuning of any specific applications.
SMG2000 was selected somewhat at random, since it is moderately large and 
we have demonstrated for many years that we can compile it easily with ROSE.
