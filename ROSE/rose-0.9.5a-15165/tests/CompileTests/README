This directory contains tests for ROSE.  All rose preprocessors should
be able to parse, process internally (generate ASTs), unparse, and
compile (with a C++ compiler)  the codes in each of these directories.

   The execution of the codes is not tested using theses tests, though
we might add that later.  A more complete test is to use a ROSE preprocessor
to compile a separate projects (like A++/P++) and then test if the resulting
libraries and executables pass the project's tests.  This can (and likely 
should) be done separately from the testing of ROSE to avoid secondary project
dependencies within ROSE's tests.

A++Tests: 
    This directory contains the A++ source code with header files and is used
    to test the parsing, construction of AST's, and unparsing.  If the tests pass
    the we know that the ROSE preprocessor has correctly read, processed, and unparsed
    the resulting files.  The test pass if ROSE generates good sufficient to compile
    properly using the target C++ compiler (KCC for the moment).

A++MDI:
   This directory contains the C code used within A++ and represents a test of
   the ROSE preprocessor to read C code, generate internal AST's, and unparse 
   it correctly (so that it will compile properly).

C++Code:
   A collection of C++ test codes (not dependent upon any external libraries (e.g. A++)).

C_Code:
   A collection of C test codes (not dependent upon any external libraries (e.g. A++)).
