/* ***********************************************************************

   Fix (Fortran Interface to X windows) is a set of routines that allow
   Fortran programs to open and draw to X windows.  This is a dummy file 
   for making the makefile portable.  If you want to try the unsupported 
   X Display option, see the comments at the head of the dummy "xdisplay.F" 
   in the main source directory.  You will be overwriting "fix_64.C" and 
   "xdisplay.F" with files from the input_templates directory.
