   The Intermediate Representation (IR) used in ROSE is called SAGE III.
SAGE III is something that we have built based on SAGE II, which was never 
completed or widely distributed. SAGE II was based on SAGE++, the improvements 
over SAGE++ were significant. SAGE II was the first version of SAGE to use the 
Edison Design Group (EDG) frontend.  We want to thank the original
developers of SAGE++ and SAGE II for their work, from which we learned a lot
through use of their object-oriented IR interface.

   We chose the name SAGE III to give sufficient credit to the original developers
of SAGE++ and SAGE II, who also suggested that we call what we are doing SAGE III.  
ROSE, of course, builds on SAGE III and adds numerous additional mechanisms, 
including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Loop Optimizations (called by ROSE users)
    \item Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Attributes (tree decoration)
    \item A family of AST Traversals (as used with Attribute Grammars)
    \item AST Rewrite mechanisms
    \item AST Query Mechanisms
    \item C and C++ code generation from SAGE III
    \item AST File I\/O
    \item Significant robustness for C, C99, and C++ (handles large DOE applications)
    \item AST Visualization
    \item and more ...
\end{itemize}

   SAGE III is an automatically generated body of software that uses ROSETTA, a tool we 
wrote and distribute with ROSE. ROSETTA is an IR generator that, as its largest and most
sophisticated test, generates SAGE III.  The connection code that was used to translate 
EDG's AST to SAGE II was derived loosely from the EDG C++ source generator and has
formed the basis of the SAGE III translator from EDG to SAGE III's IR. Under this license
we exclude the EDG source code and the translation from the EDG AST in distributions 
and make available only a binary of those parts with use EDG (front-end AST translation),
and the source to all of ROSE (which does not depend on EDG). No part of the EDG work is 
visible to the user of ROSE.  We can make the EDG source available only to those who have 
the free EDG research license.  We want to thank the developers at Edison Design Group
(EDG) for making their work so widely available under their research license program.

   Markus Schordan was the first post-doctorate researcher on the ROSE project; he made 
significant contributions while employed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), 
including the AST traversal mechanism.  We continue to work with Markus, who is now at 
Vienna University of Technology as an Associate Professor. We were also fortunate to 
leverage a significant portion of Qing Yi's thesis work (under Ken Kennedy) 
% on loop optimizations as part of her post-doc at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory with the ROSE project, 
and we would like to thank her for that work and the work she did as a post-doc at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 
We continue to work with her, although she is now at the University of Texas at San Antonio.
