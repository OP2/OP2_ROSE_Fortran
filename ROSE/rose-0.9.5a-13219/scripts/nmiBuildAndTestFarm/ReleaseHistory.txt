History of Fedora Releases
**************************

Launched in 2003 as a replacement development platform for RHEL (and in that sense as the
successor product to RHL 9), Fedora -- which was called Fedora Core through version 6
(when the Fedora Extras repository was merged into the Core package set) is
community-supported and undergoes rapid development.
