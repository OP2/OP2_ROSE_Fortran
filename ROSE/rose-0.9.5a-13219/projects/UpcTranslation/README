This project exemplifies how to use ROSE to build a UPC translator
targeted to the Berkeley UPC (BUPC) runtime system V. 2.6.0.

The BUPC runtime interface is given in
http://upc.lbl.gov/docs/system/upcr.txt . 

In particular, to demonstrate the capability of ROSE, we implements the 
static user data handling defined in 
http://upc.lbl.gov/docs/system/runtime_notes/static_data.html

We choose to use a few expanded macros to facilitate possible optimizations on
the translated AST. Original macros conforming to the runtime specification
are given as source comments. 

For example, 

int quux = 10;
/* int UPCR_TLD_DEFINE (quux, 4, 4 ) = 10; */
