TODO: work left to do:

   . bit-field (Rose does not seem to support this)
   . Complete global initialization.

   * boolean conversions to integral type when required (This should have been done during semantic analysis in Rose.)
     Add extension attribute for such boolean expressions where needed:
   * switch statement

legend:
    "." - to be done
    "*" - done but might need to be reviewed...
    "+" - would be nice but not necessary
