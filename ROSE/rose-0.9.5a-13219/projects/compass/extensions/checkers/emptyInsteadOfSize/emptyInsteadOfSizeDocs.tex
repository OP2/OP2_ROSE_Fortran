\section{Empty Instead Of Size}
\label{EmptyInsteadOfSize::overview}

While comparing the result of the size() member function on STL containers
against 0 is functionally equivalent to calling the empty() member function,
empty() is to be preferred as it is always a constant-time operation, while
size() on std::list may take linear time. This checker detects cases where the
result of size() is compared against the constant 0.

\subsection{Parameter Requirements}

This checker does not require any parameters.

\subsection{Non-Compliant Code Example}

\begin{verbatim}
#include <vector>

bool f(const std::vector<int> &v)
{
    if (v.size() > 0) // not OK: use !v.empty() instead
        return true;
    if (0 == v.size()) // not OK: use v.empty() instead
        return false;
    return false;
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Compliant Solution}

\begin{verbatim}
#include <vector>
bool f2(const std::vector<int> &v)
{
    if (!v.empty())
        return true;
    if (v.empty())
        return false;
    return false;
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Mitigation Strategies}
\subsubsection{Static Analysis} 

Compliance with this rule can be checked using structural static analysis checkers using the following algorithm:

\begin{enumerate}
\item For each member function call, see if the called member function is
named `size' and if the call is embedded in an expression that compares its
return value against the constant 0.
\item If the above check evaluates to true, emit a diagnostic.
\end{enumerate}

There are numerous ways to defeat this simple analysis, for instance by
assigning the return value from size() to a variable, by comparing the return
value against a variable that is always 0, or by calling size() through a
member function pointer. Further, the analysis only looks for member functions
named `size' but does not try to ascertain that it belongs to a `container'
(as that is not something that can be checked reliably).
