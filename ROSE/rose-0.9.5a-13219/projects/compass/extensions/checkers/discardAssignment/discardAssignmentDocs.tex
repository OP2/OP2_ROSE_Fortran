\section{Discard Assignment}
\label{DiscardAssignment::overview}

According to some coding standards, the assignment operator should not be used
within larger constructs, but only as a stand-alone expression statement; in
particular, it should not be used as the controlling expression in a branch
because it might be confused with the equality operator. This checker reports
any use of the assignment operator (built-in or overloaded) that is not the
sole expression in an expression statement.

\subsection{Parameter Requirements}

This checker does not require any parameters.

\subsection{Non-Compliant Code Example}

\begin{verbatim}
void strcpy_noncompliant(char *dest, const char *source)
{
    while (*dest++ = *source++)
        ;
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Compliant Solution}

\begin{verbatim}
void strcpy_compliant(char *dest, const char *source)
{
    char last = *source;
    do {
        last = *source;
        *dest++ = *source++;
    } while (last != '\0');
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Mitigation Strategies}
\subsubsection{Static Analysis} 

Compliance with this rule can be checked using structural static analysis checkers using the following algorithm:

\begin{enumerate}
\item For each assignment, geneate a diagnostic if its parent is not an expression statement.
\item For each assignment that has an expression statement as its parent, generate a diagnostic if that expression
statement is the controlling expression statement of a loop, if, or switch.
\end{enumerate}
