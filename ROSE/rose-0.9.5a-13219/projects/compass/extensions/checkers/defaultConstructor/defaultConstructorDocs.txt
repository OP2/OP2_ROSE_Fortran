\subsection{Introduction}
Declare a default constructor for every class you create. Although some 
compilers may generate a more efficient implementation in some instances you 
should choose a default constructor because it is more clear. Taken from
Taken from ``Elements of C++ Style''
by Misfeldt, Bumgardner, and Gray; item \#97

%Give an exact reference to the pattern in the literature.
%Here is the example:
%The reference for this checker is: H. Sutter, A. Alexandrescu:
%``C++ Coding Standards'', Item 28: ``Prefer the canonical form ++ and --. 
%Prefer calling the prefix forms''.

\subsection{Parameter Requirements}
This checker takes no parameters and inputs source file.

\subsection{Implementation}
This pattern is checked using a simple AST traversal that seeks out instances
of SgClassDefinition. The children of these instances are stored in a successor
container and looped over to find a default constructor. If no such default
constructor exists then a violation is flagged.

\subsection{Example of Failing Output Code}

%Examples of the patterns go here.

%If there is strange known behaviour, you can write a 
%subsection that describes that problem.
