ROSE/docs/README:

This directory contains documentation for the ROSE Project,
separate directories are:

Rose:
   This directory contains all the documentation (both latex and 
   Doxygen generated) for the entire ROSE project.  All documentation
   in in the subdirectory ROSE_WebPages.

testDoxygen:
   This is a staging directory for most Doxygen relevant input files.
   All the file in this directory are copied using the "make copyDocumentation"
   makefile rule (defined in ROSE/docs/testDoxygen/Makefile.am).
   This directory is where we can easily build and test just the Doxygen
   specific documentation as part of testing new ideas specific to 
   documenting ROSE better.

Rosetta:
   This directory contains documentation specific to ROSETTA.
   Rosetta is a library for construction of source code generations 
   we have developed to simplify the development of source code 
   within ROSE. For example, an application developed with ROSETTA was 
   used to generate the Sage III intermediate form used within ROSE.
   ROSETTA also helps with other related source code generation as well.
   ROSETTA is however a tool for the construction of many parts of ROSE
   and is not particularly useful to users wishing to only develop 
   source-to-source preprocessors using ROSE.

Other directories specific to 3rd party documentation used by ROSE 
might be placed here as well (e.g. PDFlib, etc.) in the future.
