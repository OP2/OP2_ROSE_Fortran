This is a directory of C++ code from the A++ library.
A++ is an array class library developed in the mid 1990's and
for which there is a companion P++ library that permits
applications using A++ to be compiled to run in distributed
memory parallel machines.  This body of code is a excellent
test code for ROSE since it is both a moderatly large project
and full on realiztic complexity (though not template complexity).

In general, if we don't use it as a test code for ROSE we often 
discover that we broke something, so we continue to use it as 
a test code within the ROSE distribution so that it will be tested
often.
