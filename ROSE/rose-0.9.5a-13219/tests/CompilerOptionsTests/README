This directory tests the ROSE options:

   These tests are currently incomplete.

1) testCpreprocessorOption
   This directory includes tests of the -E option.

2) testForSpuriousOutput
   This directory includes tests of debugging output from running the preprocessor.

3) testHeaderFileOutput
   This directory includes tests of the -H option.   

4) testOutputFileOption
   This directory includes tests of the -o option to specify the output file.

5) Rama has filename tests which test the limitations of mechanism to handle filenames.

DQ (1/9/2007): Tests needed in the future:
  1) Test the mechanism to unparse the header files directly instead of including the
     #include directives.

  2) Test the mechanism to unparse with #line directives (might not yet be an option that
    can be specified on the command line, but it needs to be there).

  3) Test the mechanism to include comments in the header files.
