This directory contains the code for computation of hidden types and declaration lists.


Questions:
   1) Why use char* instead of C++ string objects.

   2) Some test code demonstrate and infinite loop (or so it appears):
        test2001_01.C
        test2001_10.C

Comments:
   1) Need to use namespace to isolate the implementation (and types)
      from the rest of ROSE.

   2) Need more test codes (if they are available).
