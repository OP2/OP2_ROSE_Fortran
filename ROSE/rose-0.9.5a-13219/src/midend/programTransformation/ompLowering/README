An OpenMP 3.0 implementation to leverage the runtime support provided by libgomp of GCC 4.4.1
Liao, 8/10/2009

The frontend support are located in:
* C/C++ parsing: src/frontend/SageIII/omplexer.ll ompparser.yy  
* Fortran parsing: src/frontend/SageIII/ompFortranParser.C 
* persistent attribute:  a temporary data structure for storing parsing results
  src/frontend/SageIII/OmpAttribute.h OmpAttribute.C

Headers: src/frontend/SageIII/omp.h  

Please refer to the Chapter named "OpenMP support" in the ROSE manual (http://www.rosecompiler.org/ROSE_UserManual/ROSE-UserManual.pdf) for details about how to use this new feature.
