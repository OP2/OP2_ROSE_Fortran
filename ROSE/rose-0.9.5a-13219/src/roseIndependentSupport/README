This directory contains code stands on its own, is not
specific to ROSE, but which we use and wish to avoid having
be separate from the ROSE distribution.  Usually the tools
are small and not large enough to justify separate distributions
outside of ROSE.  They could be useful to external project and
we welcome there use by others. All of ROSE is open source,
though we have some dependence on EDG for C and C++ at present
and so clearly the EDG work is not open source.

dot2gml: contains a translator from dot to gml.

graphicalUserInterface: contains the initial version of QRose (which
   will be replace by a later version this summer from Gabriel Coutinho at
   Imperial College London).

graphics: contains a templated graph class based on STL
   and adapted from an STL book (referenced in the source code).
   This might be the graph class that we use in ROSE.

tview: Text visualization (reads embedded codes in text to
   highlight the test). See the tview/README file for more
   details.

visualization: this is the old dot2gl program that has been
   replaced by our use of zgrviewer for the visualization of 
   dot graphs).
