This directory contains the code fror translators that read
the input probram and output DOT graphs for the AST.

DOTGenerator: 
   Generates a graph as a tree which shows the AST.

dotGeneratorWholeASTGraph: 
   Generates a graph which shows all available connections 
   (thus more than a tree).  The AST is imbedded in this more 
   complex graph which includes types, symbols, etc. This 
   implementation does only minor filtering of things like
   source poisition data structures.  More complex graphs are 
   possible to build, but would require modifiying the code in 
   the directory: ROSE/src/frontend/SageIII/astVisualization.
