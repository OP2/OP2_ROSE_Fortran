========== Compiling the source-to-source translator  ==========

This step now depends on the SCons build system.

The following 2 environment variables must be set for compilation to
succeed:
1) ROSE_HOME: the base directory of your ROSE installation.
2) BOOST_HOME: the base directory of your Boost libraries.

To compile, run:
'scons'

To clean, run:
'scons -c'

========== Running the source-to-source translator  ==========

SCons installs the translator binary 'translator' in the 'bin'
directory.

The LD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to be set to contain the ROSE (librose.so)
and JVM libraries (libjvm.so) to be able to run the translator.

========== Adding to the Git repository ==========

To add new source and header files to the git repository, run:
'python AddToGitRepository.py'

This will first check which files are untracked before adding them.
